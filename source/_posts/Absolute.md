# Prologue

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/yy0cofg5.png">

(Location: Michigan Townscape)

(One year before ES’s founding. After the Yumenosaki Revolution, Spring)

(A certain place in Detroit, Michigan, United States of America)

(In the WNW district, where the competition for the top idols of the world, Absolute, is held)

**Jun**: —”Shaka”?

**Nagisa**: …… That’s the name of the world’s number one idol?

**Hiyori**: Even though they’re a foreigner, isn’t that the name of the Shakyamuni Buddha?(1) That’s fairly unusual, isn’t it?

**Ibara**: If I’m not mistaken the Buddha is already a foreigner to begin with. It’s perverted nationalism and simply arrogant to believe everything comes from one’s own country.

In regards to idol culture, it’s the same thing.

This country’s idol culture was built from the ground up by a certain “great person,” and has prevailed to this day— or at least that’s what the public believes.

Naturally, that great person can’t create perfection from nought. He is not God, after all.

That person invented what we call idols– and while he built up and developed the idol industry, that foundation gave life to a sort of culture.

That culture was produced right in this very Detroit, Michigan, and continues to this day through what’s known as “Absolute” culture.

All around the world, there was an explosion of unique trends stemming from rock n’ roll culture, blending with American pop culture to yield a strange new form—

As a result, the so-to-speak “prototypical idol” arose in this area and the popularity and economic boost revived what had once been an area on the decline—

Well, that’s the general feel of what happened.

**Jun**: Jeez, that explanation went in one ear and right out the other.

**Ibara**: Fufu. Reliable workers don’t need to understand everything, Jun♪

**Nagisa**: …… That’s true, isn’t it.

…… If I remember correctly, Father liked foreign cultures.

**Jun**: ? Um, what d’you mean your old man?

**Nagisa**: …… Father possibly also witnessed this area’s “Absolute” in his youth.

…… He was deeply moved by it, and built the groundwork for his own utopia– his own paradise.

…… And thus, idols were born.

**Hiyori**:  History and feelings, huh? That kind of talk is SO bo~ring!

So what’s the big idea? You crammed us into a plane to fly to some foreign country, and all you do is talk about your history knowledge?

**Ibara**: No, of course not.

Our goal is to observe the source, or rather, the home, of idol culture, Absolute’s, current form.

To the whole world, Japan’s idol culture just looks like Absolute culture that’s popular in the islands of the Far East.

By overturning that expectation, we will conquer the world.

And that’s why we’ll be observing the enemy’s movements.

**Hiyori**: Seriously, bragging with that big mouth of yours, conquering the world? I thought we were still hardly recognized back home, hm?

I wouldn’t call a child who’s only just started playing baseball going to see a Major League game “enemy observation!” It’s quite funny\~♪

**Ibara**: Yes, yes, just now I was certainly talking big.

Even so, one day it surely will happen.

**Nagisa**: …… Well, it’s better to dream big, isn’t it?

**Jun**: Uuu. I don’t think I have the time to check out Absolute n’ stuff\~……

I’m kinda embarrassed to say it but this is my first time being overseas so I’m pretty hyped.

It’s pretty amazing…… As a kid I was stuck inside my cramped closet, but now I’ve crossed the ocean to a distant country.

**Ibara**: Together, we’ll advance further, wider, deeper, higher—

Undoubtedly, we’ll be able to see as many wonderful sights as we’d like.

**Jun**: You’ve been talking about something like a dream this whole time\~. Haha, you’re also having fun being overseas♪

**Ibara**: I’ll admit, I’m somewhat moved. Yes, I am excited as well.

At last, “I” feel like I’ve reached the feet of the pieces of shit who ruined my life.

**Jun**: ………?

**Nagisa**: …… I don’t really understand, but shouldn’t we stop chatting and head to the venue?

…… Absolute maintains its primordial wildness, and the spectators are so discordant that it’d be nigh unthinkable in japan.

**Hiyori**: Well, its catchphrase is “Fanatic Festival,” isn’t it?

**Jun**: Is it a horror movie or somethin’?

**Ibara**: Yes. It would be a disaster if our seats were stolen by such raucous people, so let’s get to the venue early.

Please take care to not get lost, everyone♪

# To Abhor the Impure World

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/372r146t.png">

(Location: Airport (Lobby))

(Time has passed to the present day. The first year of ES’s establishment, the last third of February)

(Michigan, United States of America International Airport)

**Nagisa**: …… Ibara. Ibara, it’s time to wake up.

…… Without you to guide us, we’ll be stranded, won’t we?

**Ibara**: …… Nn…

My apologies. I fell asleep, it seems.

**Nagisa**: …… Were you having a nightmare of some kind? You were crying out in your sleep?

**Ibara**: No—I was merely dreaming about the first time I came here with you all.

**Nagisa**: …… I see. Ah, how nostalgic.

**Ibara**: Yes. However, this truly is the greatest mistake of my life. Once we safely reached our destination, did I relax? Or was I just exhausted—

I thought I’d just rest my eyes for 5 minutes, but before I knew it I had lost consciousness.

**Hiyori**: That’s because you were working on the plane. You idiot, you work idiot.

The human body isn’t supposed to work for 24 hours straight, y’know.

But because you forced yourself to work, you burnt yourself out and your body forcefully shut down.

It’s like you’re no different from a machine.

**Jun**: Ahaha. I thought you’d be diligent about that kind of thing~, but I guess you’re resting when you should be resting, huh?

**Ibara**: I was trying to be diligent about that myself. If I force myself to work, my efficiency will only decrease and won’t lead to results.

However, as expected, we’re currently in a situation where we can’t keep up unless we spare no time for sleep and engage in the black labor that the people of Japan love so much—

**Nagisa**: …… I see. That sounds difficult… I wish there was something I could do to help.

**Ibara**: And whose fault do you think it is that I’m so busy\~?

**Hiyori**: Hey, that sounds like something Jun-kun would say! My dear juniors have become really good friends before I knew it♪

**Jun**: Ohiisan, sometimes I have no idea what kind of logic led you to that kind of conclusion. Are you some kind of girl that only blabs about feelings or whatever\~?

**Hiyori**: Wha- that’s quite the misogynistic statement, isn’t it?

You have to be careful, even if America is a country we’re well-acquainted with.

Even so, a foreign country is a foreign country—common sense, laws, ambience, everything is different here.

**Ibara**: Indeed. America is a country that’s prone to lawsuits, if you conduct yourself carelessly then you’ll be sent straight to a jail cell.

**Jun**: Huuuh…… But the last time we came here nothin’ really happened, right?

Obviously I know I shouldn’t lose focus n’ say “what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas~.”

**Nagisa**: …… Nothing happened, right?

…… So that’s how you perceived it.

**Jun**: ? Huh, did something happen last time that I didn’t know about? 

**Nagisa**: …… No. This is probably my own personal concern.

**Jun**: ………?

**Ibara**: Ahh seriously, if I leave you alone you’ll talk forever…… I was also nodding off, so I’m not really in any position to be bossy or scold you all.

Our time here is limited, so let’s act quickly and purposefully.

**Hiyori**: But today is just a travel day with nothing else to do, right? So wouldn’t it be fine to drop off our luggage at the hotel and go sightseeing or shopping?

**Ibara**: That’s alright, but before that—

Let’s greet the one responsible for calling us to this place.

There’s no point or need to be polite, though.

**Gatekeeper**: —Hey, you brats.

As usual, yer all are living with reckless abandon aren’t ya? Well?

**Jun**: Gatekeeper!?

**Nagisa**: …… It’s been a while.

**Gatekeeper**: Hey, child of God, yer looking like the Boss more and more these days.

Ya say it’s been a while, but it hasn’t been that long at all. Last time we met was during that main battle of SS, so it’s only been 2 months.

Well, I guess the sense of time is different for an old man like me and you brats.

**Hiyori**: Brat this, brat that…… As always, you sour the mood every time you open your mouth.

**Gatekeeper**: How rude, if ya make a fool of someone, it’ll cost ya yer business, see. Ya have a habit of threatening people over every little thing, like a stray cat.

**Ibara**: If you act too provocative, then you’ll only make more enemies, won’t you?

**Gatekeeper**: Ah? So what? It’s fine if ya kill the enemy. In fact, you’ll increase yer means of living—right?

Oh well. I’m also not in a position where I can be showing my face in public, so if we’re just chatting then let’s move somewhere else.

Shut up and follow me, youngsters.

(Location: Hotel (Lobby))

(An hour later. Eden’s accommodations, in the lobby of a luxury hotel)

**NEGI**: “Howdy howdy, welcome to America, the land of freedom~♪”

**Jun**: ………?

**NEGI**: “Eh. There isn’t even one kid from Yumenosaki here. I greeted you with a merry spirit too, how embarrassing.”

**Gatekeeper**: Oy NEGI-bouzu (1), I told ya to not show that ‘face’ of yours didn’t I. I’ll kill you.

**NEGI**: “Don’t call me NEGI-bouzu. I might be a Negi (2) but I’m not a Bouzu, I haven’t really taken care of it, but can’t you see this long, shiny hair I have?

Besides, if I keep being cooped up in my room, my legs would rot away. Can’t I just talk a walk within the hotel, uncle?

Or was it a lie when you said that ‘I have control over every nook and corner of this hotel, so it’s safe and secure’?

Adults are liars…… I can’t take it anymore, I’m running away from home.”

**Gatekeeper**: Stop playing around having fun pretending to be an adolescent teen, we don’t even have that sort of relationship in the first place— don’t we?

**NEGI**: “Technically in name, you’re my guardian, aren’t you, uncle?”

**Gatekeeper**: In this whole wide world, is there even a law that requires every family in this world to behave the same way as those families from Trendy Dramas? (3)

Even if there was a law like that, did you think I would abide by it?

**NEGI**: “Ahaha. That just now, it’s a winning argument. I’ve lost.

Sorry. I just wanted to try playing parent and child for a little bit. I might have been lonely.”

**Gatekeeper**: Talk about sentimental things like that with someone else. Don’t bring that up with me. You’re annoying.

**Nagisa**: …… I see.

…… I just guessed from the contents of that conversation. You’re that NEGI-san who was the talk of Yumenosaki for a while, aren’t you?

…… Perhaps I should be calling you Hitsugi Kurone-kun instead.

**NEGI**: “Either one is fine, though. My little brother hasn’t been appearing much lately, that you’d have thought he died. Even though I’m the deceased one, or something like that.

……I’m really worried.“

**Nagisa**: ……Is that so. I pray that you’ll find your brother.

**NEGI**: “Yeah. Hehe, you look scary, but you’re a good person, huh.”

**Gatekeeper**: Shut yer traps and be quiet. Talking to the ‘ghost’ (4) dampened my mood (5), but from now on is the real world— let’s talk business.

Well, just sit down. Just like NEGI-bouzu said earlier, I have complete control over this hotel.

There’s no chance of someone eavesdropping on us from anywhere— so there’s no need to be wary.

**Ibara**: I’m more wary of you than anyone else, though.

**Gatekeeper**: Ah, is that so. I know yer can’t help it, but don’t be so prickly. This time I’m yer ally— 

If you get nervous and be on guard even with your allies, your nerves are guaranteed to get too worn out and you won’t last.

**Ibara**: You’re the one making an unreasonable demand by telling people to not get nervous in front of a foreign Mafia bigshot.

Having said that, it is just as you said.

Firstly, shall we relax and talk about work?

**Gatekeeper**: Yeah. —This time, there are three jobs I want to ask you, Eden, to do.

One of which is to stand on the stage that even that Boss (6) aspired to, the stage of Absolute, which can even be said as the world’s number one idol festival, as Japan’s representative .

**Hiyori**: Well, I did hear about there being that sort of work. I just didn’t think the client would be that Gatekeeper.

**Ibara**: If I said so, everyone would have refused, wouldn’t you? Due to this Uncle going on a rampage during SS, he’s extremely hated by ES idols you see~?

**Gatekeeper**: How shameless. It’s not like you’re well-liked either, little Ibara.

**Ibara**: Yes. However, I put those sort of personal concerns aside and take advantage of business opportunities.

It’ll be an enormous achievement if you can stand out at the world’s best idol festival ‘Absolute’. If you were to speak of it in more coarse terms; you’ll be able to get as much wealth, fame, and gold as you please.

After SS Finals ended with the farce “Everyone won ♪ All’s well that ends well ♪”, the current social position of ES idols is to go along with the crowd.

If we can be recognised by the world as having succeeded in Absolute, each and every one of us in Eden will become an exceptional existence within ES.

**Gatekeeper**: But can yer really stand out on the world stage— is the question. 

Since I got no interest in idols, I don’t know the real situation, but judging by the rumours, almost all of the audience of Absolute don’t even recognise the likes of you, yer know.

**Ibara**: From the perspective of the people of this country, we’re just some kings of a hill coming from a far-off island country merrily touting the title of ES Big 3, you see.

Naturally, to overturn that rumour, I’ll work out a plan so that our names would resound sonorously in this country as well.

**Gatekeeper**: Well, I’m looking forward to it.

Though it might be unthinkable in your country, the idols in this country— or should I say, the participants of Absolute, are something like racehorses or so to speak.

They openly hold bets on stuff like who would get the overall victory; sums of money that would make you doubt your eyes would be fluttering about. For the lot of em from this country, it’s no different from a boxing title match. 

If you do an idol concert meant to entertain everyone or something like normal, you’re in for a lot of hurt.

A softy like that will follow the same fate as a little baby rabbit being put in the cage of a wild beast.

TL NOTES:
<ol>
<li>坊主 (Bouzu): usually means a buddhist priest, or someone with a close-cropped hair (like a monk), thus Negi’s comment about it. The way GK is using it is more uncommon, but still a valid usage; it’s an old-timey, condescending way of saying ‘boy’ or ‘sonny’.</li>
<li>A ネギ (Negi) is a welsh onion. However phonetically, it sounds similar to 禰宜 (Negi), which is a Shinto senior priest.</li>
<li>A Trendy Drama is a genre of JP tv dramas that focus on contemporary real life issues. They were popularized in Japan in the 80’s and 90’s .</li>
<li>Specifically, GK is referring to an お化け (Obake) which while means ‘something that changes’ and is a specific type of Yokai, but it also could be shorthand/colloquial for an actual ‘ghost’ as in the spirit of the deceased that is specified as 幽霊 (Yuurei).</li>
<li>水を入れられちまったが - lit. pouring water.</li>
<li>The word he used here is 御大 (Ondai) and Mod assumes it indicates he’s talking about Godfather because that’s how GK referred to him before this. ‘That’ Boss as opposed to the current one (Nagisa), perhaps.</li>

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/cw8fxfeg.png">

(Location: Hotel (Lobby))

**Nagisa**: …… It’s not like we were completely unable to comprehend the ambience of Absolute.

**Hiyori**: Yep. Around the time Eden was first formed, we once came to observe Absolute. 

Of course there would be differences in point of view between being in the audience and being a performer, but we were at least able to grasp the atmosphere.

We thought that Absolute’s stage would be the same as any other idol stage, but it’s completely different. Fundamentally different.

**Gatekeeper**: It’s good if yer can comprehend that. Besides, even if yer lose big time, it’ll still be a good experience for yer.

It seems back home, you were basically undefeated and became a Tengu (1). It’ll be good medicine for yer to have yer high nose to be snapped broken even if just once.

**Ibara**: It seems that you don’t think we have any chance of winning, Uncle.

**Gatekeeper**: No, I don’t know. There might be a 1 in 10,000 chance you will.

I’ve said this a lot of times before but I’m uninterested in idols, so there is no way for me to know just how far you’ll be accepted by the world. 

My first pick to win isn’t yer guys, yer know. Whether the racehorses I didn’t buy betting tickets for wins or loses is of no concern to me, as long as they don’t get in the way of my first pick.

**Jun**: That first pick would be……?

**NEGI**: “Hm? Why are you looking at me? I’m not going to appear on something as frightening as Absolute, you know?”

**Jun**: No, you’re just wearing something that looks like a stage outfit so I thought you’re in the same profession.

**NEGI**: “Aha. I made this my daily outfit because it’s my favorite. Because Anzu made this outfit for me, you see.”

**Gatekeeper**: Hmm. My first pick, or rather, first on the list of candidates to win even for the public— as a matter of course, is the six-times successive champion of Absolute, the number one idol in the world.

Even you would at least know his name, right?

**Nagisa**: …… “Shaka.”

**Gatekeeper**: Heeh, so you did know. For some reason you can barely hear his name in Japan, though.

**Ibara**: I’m throwing the words you said earlier back at you; how shameless. Either you or for instance, someone like Priest sealed off that information didn’t you, because that person known as Shaka is— 

**Gatekeeper**: That’s right. The second thing I want to ask from yer is something related to that.

Convince that asshole Shaka to get on stage one way or another. Because for some reason, that guy is sulking (2) and saying something like he won’t appear on Absolute this time around.

That rumour has leaked to the public, sending all the involved parties as well as the fans who bought betting tickets into confusion.

If the odds are rough, it’ll be profitable for the gambling dealer, and it’ll be an acclaimed hot topic so that’s still a matter of great congratulations though.

**Hiyori**: Aah, as expected, the gambling that’s happening in Absolute is—

**Gatekeeper**: Of course, I’m (3) managing that side. It’s a good source of income, yer see, because in every country there are fools who’ll invest in an uncertain future.

No, they’re dreaming idiots who throw their gold down the drain.

I’ll just clean out the mud from the gold those idiots had thrown down the drain, and use it for something more useful. There aren’t any other philanthropists who’ll go to this length like me out there. Yeaah?

**Ibara**: Putting that Mafia self-justification speech aside, why do you think we would be able to convince Shaka-shi?

**Jun**: Even I think that part’s strange~ We’re not even acquainted with that person called Shaka, y’know?

**Hiyori**: We saw him from a distance in a previous Absolute, though.

**Gatekeeper**: Beats me. Shaka is the one asking for yer, I don’t know why either. You’ll meet up later, so ask the person himself later.

And then, properly convince him and give him motivation.

I said that the gambling den being rough would be more profitable for the dealer, but it’ll be fatal for us in terms of attracting customers if he ends up not showing up.

I’ll be in trouble if the profit from Absolute itself plummets because the gambling is directly based on a part of it.

**Ibara**: U\~m……In a business setting, this sort of situation is when you’re supposed to say ‘Leave it to me! I’ll show you I’ll follow through magnificently!’ while brimming with confidence, huh.

As you’d expect for this time’s situation, we don’t know Shaka-shi’s intentions, so we can’t make promises without due consideration, see?

**Gatekeeper**: Well, I’m just telling you to try doing what you can. It’s not often you get to have the chance to talk with a World Champion, so just think of this as a good experience, yer little chicks. (3)

So then, for the third and last request— well, this one is relatively trivial.

It’s fine to do it when you have the time, I want yer to keep my NEGI-bouzu company.

**NEGI**: “Hm? Me?”

**Gatekeeper**: She can’t help it, but I can’t watch this kid keep on moping around like that. Play with her and get her to be lively like how kids are supposed to be.

It’s depressing to be with a gloomy-looking ghost day in and day out.

**Ibara**: Well, I don’t particularly mind doing that….. It’s not like you though. After all this time, has a real life heinous Mafia bigshot like you awoken to fatherhood? (4)

**Gatekeeper**: Ah? That’s not it, I’m a rotten-to-the-very-core villain.

Still. If a little kitten strangely got attached and cuddled up to me, I might just start to feel like feeding it for fun.

It’s the same with Anzu. I thought if I do that, I might see something interesting.

I have hopes for you too, Eden. Try to entertain me as much as you can.

TL NOTES:
<ol>
<li>天狗 (Tengu): Either a Yokai or Shinto Kami depending on who you ask. Appearance wise; they have a red face and a long nose. Associated with being harbingers of war and sometimes with ascetics. Calling someone a Tengu is akin to calling them a braggart as Tengu are often depicted as proud beings.</li>
<li>へそを曲げる (Heso o mageru): An idiom that literally translated is ‘to bend his bellybutton’, but means to be cranky, or be sulky.</li>
<li>The word used is うち (uchi) which refers to the state of belonging to something, and it could be ‘us’ or ‘mine’.</li>
<li>ヒヨコ (Hiyokko): lit. little bird, usually means ‘rookie’ colloquially, but earlier in this chapter, GK was making references to Tengu when talking about Eden, which are often depicted with avian features, so Mod felt it’s better to use the little birds/chicks definition.</li>
<li>The word Ibara uses here for fatherhood is “父性” (fusei), which happens to be a homophone for the word “不正”, which means “injustice/wrongdoing/fraud”.</li>

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/bfbja31q.png">

(Location: Luxury Hotel (Guest Room))

(That night. A room in the same hotel, Eve’s shared room)

**Jun**: Hahh…… The biggest idol festival in the world, Absolute, huuh?

Just like during “SS”, the fairly heavy story continues……I’m a lower middle class person (1) so it’s honestly making me exhausted.

**Hiyori**: Ahaha. It’s a story with a viper in it, so it’s a given that the story would be heavy. ♪ (2) 

**Jun**: I wonder if that guy Ibara’s doing okay…… It might just be my imagination, but lately, hasn’t he been uncharacteristically and weirdly serious lately?

That guy would be more like, doing something sinister while roaring with laughter. It’ll be more like him.

**Hiyori**: Then the usual pattern would be that he makes a mistake and loses, saying “Eek, you’ll be sorry for this later!” and run away while biting his handkerchief♪

……I think he can’t help it though.

It was the same way during SS too. The story concerning the previous idol industry’s God seems to be concerned with Nagisa and Ibara’s ‘family line’.

If those stories are regarding the blood that flows in his body, and thus regarding fate, it can’t even be made into a funny story.

**Jun**: …… When Nagi-senpai and Ibara are talking about “that topic”, they don’t let us in at all. It’s frustrating, huh.

**Hiyori**: It’s because we’re in that sort of a carefree position, they can feel at ease when we’re together with them, right?

Because regarding that problem, we’re a third party- neither an ally nor an enemy, right?

On the contrary! If we become “a related party” too, it’ll be too complicated and hard to understand!

**Jun**: But still. We’re friends, so I want to share the heavy load with everyone. I don’t want to be left out you know~?

**Hiyori**: You’re a good boy, Jun-kun.

I’ve already given up on “things like that” during the early stages, you see.

**Jun**: ………?

**NEGI**: “—Good evening. I’m sorry for disturbing you this late at night.”

**Jun**: Woah, NEGI…-SAN! Ee, eh, the door’s properly locked— where did you get in from!?

**NEGI**: “Hehe. I’m a ghost, so I can go through walls.

That’s just a joke. My tsundere Uncle just normally gave me a Master Key that would let me enter any place within the hotel.“ (3)

**Hiyori**: I understand the logic in that, but a girl should not be visiting the room of someone of the opposite sex this late at night.

Even if we don’t mind, gossip mongers do exist in every country.

**NEGI**: “Mm. Well, I don’t think that sort of people will be infiltrating this hotel.

I mean, as expected of the idol and son of a distinguished family “Hiyori-sama”, huh? Even though you look frivolous, you unexpectedly do take care of things like that properly?”

**Hiyori**: You know about me?

**NEGI**: “More or less. I did look into things during my spare time. About people who seem like they might be involved in Anzu’s tale (4).

I want to help her the next time she gets into a tough spot. 

More importantly. I don’t want to stay for too long, so I’ll tell you my business quickly.

I want you to keep this a secret from Uncle “Gatekeeper” as well as the two from “Adam” who seems to be connected to “that topic”, though—

—I’m asking you to help Shaka.

I wonder if it’s possible for you Hiyori-sama to use your political influence or something to somehow help that person, that Shaka.”

**Jun**: Err, by Shaka you mean— that rumored Shaka-san?

**Hiyori**: You’re acquainted with him, NEGI-chan?

**NEGI**: “Mm. You see, Shaka is actually someone involved with someone who’s like my father.”

**Jun**: When you say father, do you mean Gatekeeper……?

**NEGI**: “Does it seem like it? I’d be happy if it’s true but it’s not; My father is Priest. That foolish, idiotic, worst piece of shit who sought eternal glory.

It seems that those from ES have subjugated him by force, but even now that persistent connection remains.

I can’t really say that it’s been an ‘All’s well that ends well’ situation where the bad guy’s been eliminated, can I.”

**Jun**: I don’t really get it but…… The plan is that we’re supposed to have an official face-to-face meeting with that Shaka-san tomorrow right? Isn’t that late?

**NEGI**: “Shaka himself said so. That guy told Uncle that he’s going to skip Absolute because he has no motivation for it— or something like that.

The truth is different. Shaka is frightened.”

**Jun**: Does that mean he’s afraid of standing on stage? I don’t even have to try to sympathise with that〜 Even the number one idol in the world gets like that huh?

<br>

TL NOTES:
<ol>
<li>小市民 (shoushimin): implies (but not limited to) somewhat conservative lower middle class people.</li>
<li>This is a pun; Hiyori said that the story has a 毒蛇 (Dokuhebi), which is Ibara’s usual nickname. The second part of Dokuhebi sounds similar to ヘヴィ (Heavy) in Japanese.</li>
<li>Yes she did call GK a tsundere.</li>
<li>This ‘tale’ is 物語 (Monogatari) which is more of an epic tale, rather than the word ‘story’ 話 (hanashi) used by Hiyori and Jun in this conversation.</li>

(Location: Luxury hotel (Guest Room))

**NEGI**: “Nope. Shaka’s simply afraid for his own physical safety.

Shaka believes that his life is being targeted.

That person has the temperament of a prodigy, so his heart is very delicate. So much so that fear could get him recruited into a strange religion— ”

**Hiyori**: The Buddha (1) joining a religion? This can’t even be made into a funny story, though?

**NEGI**: “Yeah. It doesn’t give off a very good image though, so it’s being kept a secret from the world.. Shaka’s behaviour has been really dangerous lately, you see. Because he’s caught up in that weird religion.

However, a religion is supposed to soothe your heart and console you, but unless it can remove the fundamental cause of your fear, your true spirit will not gain salvation. 

That’s what Shaka said. It really does sound religious-ish, huh?”

**Hiyori**: So basically, we just need to remove “that something” that Shaka-san is afraid of, right? But, are we even capable of doing something like that?

**NEGI**: “I’m not expecting you to go that far. I just want you to safeguard Shaka somewhere safe till the dust settles down.

I have the technique that allows you to transform the human form. It can make it seem like Shaka is a different person, and it can even make it possible for us to send him off to lead a new life.

But… I don’t have the methods to let that Shaka run far away.

Because as you can see, I’m currently a caged bird.”

**Hiyori**: Poor you and Shaka-san. I do feel sympathy for the both of you. Is there any merit for us if we were to listen to your request?

**NEGI**: “Of course there is. That’s why this is less of a request and more like a deal.

Shaka has won Absolute six consecutive times. Naturally he’s the top candidate for the championship this time, too.

This time, instead of that guy taking part, he’ll introduce you, Eden, as his stand-in.

At that moment, you’ll go from being some undiscovered idols from a different country that nobody really knows about to rising as championship candidates bearing that Shaka’s seal of approval.

The attention on you will be sudden and explosive, you know. After the fact, whether or not you can win Absolute would depend on you though.”

**Hiyori**: That’s attractive, but it’s a nobleman’s duty to help a pitiful person.

Unfortunately, I can’t comply with that deal.

**NEGI**: “Why’s that?”

**Jun**: Y-yeah. It looks like they’re in a fix, so isn’t it fine to just help ‘em?

**Hiyori**: I’d like to help if possible too, but if I take on that deal, I wouldn’t be able to fulfill that request from Gatekeeper.

**Jun**: Ah— Is, is that so.

**Hiyori**: That man asked us to convince Shaka-san to take part in Absolute.

But if I let Shaka-san escape, I wouldn’t be able to complete that request.

To put it simply; I’m sorry, but I already had a prior contract.

Just by observing the particulars of what happened during SS, it’s clear to see that trashing a promise with Gatekeeper will lead to terrifying things.

If it’s up to me, I would not be able to do it no matter what.

I’d like to avoid any situations that would cause trouble to Jun-kun, Nagisa-kun, and I suppose Ibara, as well as my own family back home, you see.

That’s why. I’m sorry, NEGI-chan.

**NEGI**: “It’s fine. I already knew it was an unreasonable request.

Still. Now that it’s come to this, what should I do? I’m in trouble, I don’t have anyone else to rely on.”

**Hiyori**: I figured. When you’re asking for help from us whom you haven’t had any relation to at all until now, I can see that you really have too little leads.

**NEGI**: “Mm. It might look like I’m striving to make every effort, but I’m still a feeble girl.

In the face of an overwhelmingly violent fate, all I can do is cry myself to sleep.”

**Hiyori**: For the time being, I’ve accepted your feelings. We’ll try to cater to Shaka-san wishes to the extent that our position allows for.

That all depends on tomorrow’s meeting.

To be frank, I can’t put my life on the line for an idol from a different country that I have never met or talked to, who is not even my family or my friend.

I guess I’m cold.

**NEGI**: “No. Even the Sun would not be able to make the world nice and warm when it’s just like this dead of night, right?

You’ve mentioned this earlier, but there is a possibility that it might be too late tomorrow…… But it can’t be helped, there’s barely anything else that can be done right now.

Yes, I understand. I’ll go back to my nest and try to think of a way to solve this problem on my own. Sorry for disturbing you this late at night.”

**Hiyori**: NEGI-chan.

I don’t know that much about what happened in Yumenosaki, but if you do something rash again, you’ll likely make Anzu-chan sad.

**NEGI**: “…… Yes, I know.

It seems there are people who would be sad as though it was a person who had died even though it’s just the disappearance of a ghost— even in a world this shitty.”

(Location: Hotel (Lobby))

(The next morning. The lobby of the same hotel.)

**Jun**: Huh? Shaka is missing?

**Hiyori**: That’s……?

**NEGI**: “………”

**Ibara**: Hm? Do you know anything?

**Hiyori**: Well—

(Whispering) NEGI-chan, what did you do? We couldn’t help, but you let Shaka-san escape all on your own……?

**NEGI**: “(Whispering) No, I’m sorry, I’m as surprised as you are.

Shaka was a superstar on the management side of Absolute, or rather, he was the best money tree in this region.

He was a treasure and a savior in this land known as WNW.”

**Jun**: I don’t care, but why is this region called the WNW area? What does it stand for?

**NEGI**: “Whole New World.”

**Hiyori**: A story about how a magic lamp can make dreams come true?(1)

**NEGI**: “Anyway, Shaka, who’s won Absolute six times in a row, is fiercely protected by the management.

For him to be attacked and kidnapped— something like that is impossible.

Even the military wouldn’t be able to do it, Shaka is isolated in a fortress-like place with perfect defenses.

…… (Whispering) That’s why I wanted to let him escape, but I’ve been having trouble.”

**Ibara**: In fact, if such an attack were to occur, it would cause an uproar, and the management would be willing to pay a bounty to find the culprit and exact their revenge.

However, at the moment, the management side is merely worried saying “Shaka has disappeared”—

Judging by their attitude, Shaka-shi may not have been abducted by someone, but rather may have disappeared of his own volition.

**Hiyori**: It was said that Shaka-san refused to appear on Absolute and that he hated it— so much so that he disappeared.

**NEGI**: “Yes. But isn’t that impossible? Like I’ve said many time before, Shaka is imprisoned in a fortress-like place.

Even if he had voluntarily disappeared, I think it would’ve been difficult without someone else’s help.”

**Ibara**: So that’s why the management is confused. At the moment, it seems like they’re trying to figure out the truth from both perspectives of kidnapping and spontaneous disappearance.

**Hiyori**: It’s also possible that he was abducted in some impossible way, like flying through the sky on a magic carpet.(1)

**Ibara**: I don’t think that’s possible, but…… Aren’t you too enamored with the acronym WNW?

Asde from that, the fact that Shaka-shi has disappeared is relatively unimportant to us.

**Jun**: Today we were scheduled to meet with that guy, but we ended up having free time, though~?

**Ibara**: That’s true, but the problem for us is that at the same time that Shaka-shi has disappeared, so too has His Excellency.

**Hiyori**: Nagisa-kun!? Why didn’t you say that sooner?

I don’t care about Shaka-san, I don’t even know his face so he’s just “someone I don’t care about,” y’know?

But Nagisa-kun is our precious friend and family!

**Jun**: N-Nagi-senpai is? He’s disappeared?

**Ibara**: Yes…… I may have been careless, but I slept soundly and when I woke up in the morning, I noticed that His Excellency wasn’t in the bed next to mine.

His Excellency likes to take walks in the morning, so it’s possible that he’s just wandering around the area.

No matter how brilliant His Excellency is, would he really act so carelessly in a foreign country where he doesn’t know what’s right and left? He didn’t ask permission from me as his roommate, and he didn’t leave a letter so……?

Additionally, the disappearance of Shaka-shi occurred at the same time, so I’ve decided to not be so optimistic.

If things went wrong, His Excellency and Shaka-shi may have disappeared for the same reason.

**Jun**: Yeah, two people disappearing at the exact same time sounds like they could be related.

**Ibara**: Indeed. I’m planning to join up with Uncle Gatekeeper, who seems to be looking into this, and investigate the disappearances.

On a personal level, I would be in trouble if His Excellency disappeared here.

**Hiyori**: Yes yes. Ibara also cares about Nagisa-kun and loves him.

**Ibara**: …… However, at the moment it’s unclear what’s happening, so I was wondering if His Highness and Jun could wait here in this relatively safe hotel.

Since Shaka-shi has disappeared from a fortress-like place, it’s hard to say that it’s completely safe here too— but it’s better than wandering around outside.

**Hiyori**: Excuse me? What are you talking about, I’ll also spare no expenses searching for Nagisa-kun too, right?

**Ibara**: We don’t have any knowledge of the area or anything, you know? His Highness’ family’s prestige doesn’t work here, so can you laymen listen to me?

To be honest, it’s a nuisance. Putting it mildly, it’s already difficult, so I can’t watch over you at the same time.

So, could you please be well-behaved and wait for me?

**Hiyori**: Heeh, are you treating us as dead weight? You’ve become quite full of yourself, even though you’re just Ibara.

**Jun**: Hey, hey, is this really the time to be fighting each other?

I think Ibara is right this time. I’m worried about Nagi-senpai— but there’s nothing we can do about it ourselves, so shouldn’t we behave?

**Hiyori**: Whose side is Jun-kun on!?

**Jun**: I’m not your enemy, at least\~?

There’s no point in arguing with Ibara, so please do me a favor and withdraw your fangs for now— Ohiisan?

**Hiyori**: ………

(Location: Hotel (Lobby))

**Ibara**: Then, I’ll be heading out.

Please! P-l-e-a-s-e, everyone behave, alright? Make sure to keep His Highness reined in, Jun!

**Jun**: You’re saying something impossible…… Well, I don’t want to put myself in danger, so I’ll behave, okay~?

Take care, Ibara. Please do your best to find Nagi-senpai.

**Ibara**: Of course! That person always causes unexpected trouble……!

**NEGI**: “…… He’s gone.

I only know superficial information but, who’s that ‘Ibara’ kid?”

**Jun**: Who is he…… He’s also a member of Eden, and he’s amazing at managing companies, being an idol, and being a producer all at the same time.

**NEGI**: “That’s only superficial, of course I know that.

I’m asking about essential things. What is that kid? He seems to be close to Uncle Gatekeeper, so is he someone from the underworld?

We were made to wait because it’s dangerous, but that Ibara kid seemed like he was going to participate in the investigation……

You all didn’t really try to stop him either, right?

You believe in that Ibara kid’s capability, no, his strength.

Who on earth is that kid that you guys trust so much?”

**Jun**: Well…… If you’re asking me, I don’t really know much about him either. It’s kind of my thing to not worry about small details like that, y’know~?

What’s important to me right now is that he’s a “reliable guy” that I can trust.  Basically, if we do what he says, things will turn out okay ‘n stuff.

**NEGI**: “I wonder what that’s like. This time, the scale of the story is different from what you usually experience. The nature of it is different too.

Right now, you guys may be caught up in a conspiracy involving a ton of money in a foreign country…… Probably.

No matter how talented he is, I don’t think that Ibara kid can handle it.

Even the management of Absolute, Uncle Gatekeeper, and the other adults with power and executive ability seem to be panicking.

It’s not just a school event where everyone can get along and have fun. I don’t know what kids like us can do. That Ibara kid is probably no exception.

…… It’s frustrating, but it’s the reality of the situation.”

**Jun**: ………

**Hiyori**: —Obviously! We can’t just leave it to Ibara!

**Jun**: Woah, Ohiisan!?

He had disappeared for some reason, so I thought he was just sulking and locking himself in his room again, but—

**Hiyori**: We don’t have time for that! Nagisa-kun is in a big pinch! What foul weather!

Of course, as Nagisa-kun’s best friend and family member, I can’t afford to waste time doing nothing!

Let’s go, Jun-kun! You too, NEGI-chan!

**NEGI**: “Eh- eh?”

**Jun**: W-Where are we going? Ohiisan?

**Hiyori**: You’re still as incomprehensible as ever, aren’t you? Obviously, I’m going to go find Nagisa-kun! There’s no need to ask!

**Jun**: No but, Ibara told us to wait—

**Hiyori**: I don’t recall ever being that child’s subordinate, you know? I have no obligation to listen to what he says!

**Jun**: Well I guess there’s some kind of obligation. But anyway, it’s dangerous outside the hotel—

**Hiyori**: That’s what that child thought, right? Since Shaka-san disappeared from a fortress-like place, there’s no place that’s absolutely safe!

That’s why! If it’s the same no matter where we are, I’ll choose to look for even the smallest clue!

I’m Nagisa-kun’s guardian!(1)  If that child is going through hardships, I have an obligation to help him!

Do you have any complaints, Jun-kun? It doesn’t matter if you don’t like it, I’ll just go alone!

**Jun**: …… No, I’ll be going too, okay?

Ohiisan won’t listen to me, even if I try to reason with you. If that’s how it is, I’ll feel better if I’m nearby to protect you instead of letting you wander around alone.

But being impulsive won’t help anything, so let’s prepare as much as we can at the hotel. Let’s prepare a map and drinks.

**Hiyori**: Yep! That’s essential! NEGI-chan, is there an up-to-date map of this area?

This area seems to be changing rapidly, so the maps and information online aren’t really reliable.

That’s why, since you’re living here, you’re a local, so-to-speak, and we’ll need your cooperation—we need your information.

**NEGI**: “Eh\~…… Hmm, I wonder if it’s okay?

Well, alright. It’s frustrating to just go along with what’s convenient for adults.

I can empathize with the feeling that family is important and something you want to protect.”

(Location: Gatekeeper’s Office)

(Ten minutes later. Gatekeeper’s office in the slum area of the WNW district.)

**Ibara**: —What’s the situation? What’s going on!?

**Gatekeeper**: Oyoy…… Take a deep breath, kid, let the oxygen back into yer brain.

Well, a dear friend is missing so I can understand why yer unable to keep a cool head.

**Ibara**: We’re not friends. His Excellency is the best pawn that I absolutely need to fulfill my ambitions—

**Gatekeeper**: Haha. Whatever yer say. Yer young, it’s the springtime of life, y’know.

But first, let me say that the child of god—”Nagisa-sama” is important to me, but for other people, his priority is not that high.

All that matters to everyone is Shaka.

Don’t take it the wrong way. If yer can’t read the atmosphere, yer can’t mobilize a group, and if yer don’t understand the overarching trends, yer can’t change them.

Going digging in the wrong places will only get yer garbage.

If yer going to strike gold, you’ll have to understand the worker’s feelings and arm them with the right tools, Little Ibara.

**Ibara**: …… Aye aye, teacher.

**Gatekeeper**: I don’t remember ever becoming yer private tutor.

Well, I’m invested in you and have high hopes for you— gain some experience, learn, and grow, Little Ibara.

And someday, you’ll become a great man like the Boss. If yer do that, I will bend my knee before you and serve you faithfully.

**Ibara**: I have no intention of becoming like god.

**Gatekeeper**: Is that so? It doesn’t look like that to me though, kukuku♪

Oh well. Let’s sort out the situation first. We’re the mafia, not the police, and it’s good for outsiders to investigate cases like this.

But now, as the saying goes in yer country, it’s a ‘cat’s paws’ and so on situation.(1)  I’m counting on you, “Ibanyan”♪

**Ibara**: You watched that program, huh. Thank you.

…… I’m the kind of person who often does that to make the other person angry, disturb their mind, and take control.

I mean, playing with what’s on-hand and enjoying it, that’s just like a cat isn’t it, “Gepanyan”?

**Gatekeeper**: Haha. I haven’t had a nickname since I was a kid, so I’m glad.

**Ibara**: “Gatekeeper” is also a nickname isn’t it, though I don’t really know about deriving a nickname out of a nickname. 

**Gatekeeper**: —This is just my speculation and I have no proof, but there’s no real human being like Shaka to begin with.

**Ibara**: You abruptly ended the conversation. Not real, you say?

**Gatekeeper**: The world’s greatest idol festival, Absolute, is a grand mine that generates huge profits.

In order to acquire and control the benefits there, my nemesis— “Priest” created pawns that could be moved around at his convenience.

That’s Shaka. He was probably some unidentified homeless person or something who was completely “remodeled” and turned into the world’s number one idol.

That bastard Priest has such skills. He pretends to be God and creates humans that didn’t previously exist in the world.

No, in this case it’s a monster or a demon. Those kinds of evil beings are also an existence created by an all-knowing and all-powerful god to test humanity’s faith.

To create such a monster, Shaka, and cast him into the pit called Absolute.

Essentially– Priest was snatching away the profits and prestige that belonged to others.(2)

I had presumed that, but Shaka was already a superstar who was loved by many people, especially locals.

It would be too risky to remove him through assassination.

That’s why I opened a gambling den for Absolute, which had become Priest’s domain.

Squeezing the money outta people who didn’t know a thing by making them bet— I could only do so much.

**Ibara**: And so, you were sipping the sap from the money tree Priest had grown.

**Gatekeeper**: That’s right. In a way, through Absolute, Priest and I were able to coexist. It was a win-win relationship.

Of course, I would’ve been an eyesore to Priest, who was stealing all the money, as I was also plotting to somehow steal all the profits as well.

For both Priest and I, we wanted to avoid letting the giant money tree known as Absolute wither— it was our common understanding.

And so there was a tacit agreement between us that we would maintain a cold war in this area and not launch any full-fledged attacks.

If we maintain the status quo, you can make endless profit. There’s no point in destroying such an attractive hunting ground and murdering each other.

<br>

TL NOTES:
<ol>
<li>Gatekeeper is referring to the proverb “猫の手も借りたい,” which refers to having so much work to be done that you would even ask for a cat’s help. Ibara actually uses this phrase himself in the mini-talk “A Very Busy Night 1,” which was translated as “I’m at the end of my rope.” I decided to write it out literally here since it makes Gatekeeper calling Ibara “Ibanyan” make more sense.</li>
<li>Gatekeeper uses a word here, “利益,” (rieki) that can mean both profits/benefits/advantages and the grace of God/Buddha etc. or blessings/miracles.</li>

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/2c0l5nfv.png">

(Location: Gatekeeper’s Office)

**Gatekeeper**: —However, recently, the situation changed.

With yer brats’ help, that shitty annoying Priest has been removed from this world.

That’s why I was gloating up till now— thinking I would be the one who would take over everything.

In the middle of rounding up the arrangements for that, the superstar who controlled everything in Absolute— that asshole Shaka up and disappeared.

I still don’t know the reason for that. I wonder if that asshole Shaka sensed that Priest, who was his owner (1) had disappeared, so he’s running away in search of freedom.

Or possibly that, within the believers of, or who were Priests subordinates who are still alive-

Stole the weapon named ‘Shaka’ so they themselves could become the second Priest?

**Ibara**: I’m just checking just to be sure, but you didn’t make Shaka-shi disappear did you, Uncle?

**Gatekeeper**: What would I gain from doing that? It’s true that Shaka is a fabricated idol (2) created by Priest and is not a being that I can conveniently use—

I did think about getting rid of him and creating a more convenient idol (2) in his place though.

Or should I say. To be frank, I was hoping yer brats Eden would be the ones to take that place.

I don’t understand idols. After trying to manage SS, I got even more confused.

Really, I wonder what was so fun about dealing with something so confusing, for both the Boss and Priest.

Still. Even if I can’t figure out idols, I was able to figure yer guys out to some extent.

At the very least, yer brats Eden— no, yer don’t balk at getting covered in mud if it means you get to achieve yer own ambitions.

While understanding that I’m an evil guy, yer allow evil to be evil and convert it into yer own advantage (3).

Yer don’t completely neutralize the filthy evil like the merry story protagonists of this world who are fussy about cleanliness. Yer accept good and evil to move forward.

I wanted to try betting on yer brats who are like that.

I was born evil. I can’t divert from my way of life at this point. But, as fer yer brats, yer allow that sort of evil to exist.

Even evil needs an evil place to belong to, boy. As long as yer brats continue to grace(3) us, ‘that’ will be properly guaranteed.

As long as ‘that’ is guaranteed, I’ll be fine even with becoming the gatekeeper to the paradise yer brats are building.

**Ibara**: ………

**Gatekeeper**: Don’t disappoint me too much, boy. I have high hopes for yer—— if yer a villain(4) anyway, show me that you can skillfully manage this evil.

(Location: Secret Religious Facility)

(At the same time. Secret religious facility underneath the WNW district.)

**Nagisa**: ……

(…… Eh? Was I, sleeping?

…… H~mm. It’s the situation called ‘having no recollection of one’s actions’. My head feels faint and I can’t exactly recall what happened before I went to bed.

…… That’s not good. When one’s environment changes, one needs to sleep for much longer than usual to optimize oneself to that environment.

…… Thus while being asleep, one’s body remakes and optimizes itself.

…… That’s why while on a trip, one sleeps more deeply than usual. To understand and accept the changes happening in one’s own body takes a lot of time.

…… Now then. I wonder what sort of me I have become this time?)

**NEGI?**: “Good morning.”

**Nagisa**: …… Ah, um, good morning NEGI-sa—

—That’s wrong, isn’t it. Who are you?

**NEGI?**: “Amazing. As expected of the child of God, did you discover my true identity with a single glance?”

**Nagisa**: …… Maybe it’s because I get nervous during a trip, but my senses become more sensitive than usual.

…… Just as NEGI-san’s described herself as being a ghost, she weirdly has no presence. She’s extremely difficult to perceive. A thin presence.

…… However, from you, I feel a strange pressure.

…… Just like an assembly of thousands of people, no, tens of thousands of people’s souls.

…… It’s like hell in the form of a human. If Sora-kun ‘sees’ you, his eyes would surely be crushed.

**NEGI?**: “Your perception is correct.

Right now, the kind NEGI-chan lent me her form to act as a shell so as to keep the hell that is me from overflowing.

However my rightful form is an aggregation of countless geniuses gathered by Priest.

He consolidated every conceivable genius’ data and forcibly imprisoned it inside one human—

That’s the monster that I am.”

**Nagisa**: …… Even if that’s true, it’s better to not describe yourself as a monster.

…… Furthermore, degrading yourself will make the people who love you sad.

**NEGI?**: “That’s not a problem. Because the people who love me do not exist in this world.

That’s why, I’m envious of you, Ran Nagisa.”

**Nagisa**: ………

**NEGI?**: “I’m a mud doll desperately kneaded by Priest out of fanaticism so as to mimic God.

However in the end, Priest was not able to reproduce the work of God.

I’m a dud(5) who couldn’t become Adam or even Eve.

To put it simply, it means that I’m a poorly made you, brother. (6) ”

**Nagisa**: You are—

**Shaka**: “I am the one they call Shaka.

Just like you, I’m a being who was created (7) to be the successor of God.”

(Location: Michigan Townscape)

(An hour later. Near the Absolute venue in the center of the WNW district)

**Jun**: Ohiisa\~n! NEGI-sa\~n!

There was a hot dog stand, so I bought us some food. Come to think of it, we’ve had a lot going on since this morning, so we haven’t eaten anything.

No matter what we do, we need to stay healthy.

**NEGI**: “Thank you. You’re a kind and good kid.”

**Hiyori**: Fufun, he’s an attentive kid, don’t you think? I trained him myself! (1)

**Jun**: In reality, I can’t think of any word for it other than “training”…… Ahh, my whole body is being haunted by the spirits of errand boys.

**NEGI**: “Ahaha. It’s not a bad thing, attentive kids like you can be well-liked.

Like Anzu. Hey, is Anzu doing well? I heard she was having a rough time during SS, but is she feeling depressed or anything?”

**Jun**: I think she’s fine but y’know~, that person is a lot tougher than me.

**Hiyori**: Indeed. But the problem is that everyone thinks that way, and doesn’t pay enough attention to that child as a result.

It may be an old-fashioned thing to say, but she’s still an underage girl. She needs support from those around her.

**NEGI**: “That’s how it is. This world is ruled by adults, and when children try to defy them they’ll just be crushed.”

**Jun**: Really, is there anything we can do~? I got caught up in Ohiisan’s energy and ran out of the safety of the hotel, and?

We’re supposed to search for Nagi-senpai and Shaka-san, but we don’t have any clues right now—

**Hiyori**: Yeah, it’s like trying to find a needle in a haystack, but I can’t just sit still and do nothing.

**NEGI**: “I can’t say I have a clue, but I do have a bit of an idea.

That’s why we came to the Absolute venue like this.”

**Hiyori**: Surprisingly, it’s already bustling with people.

The Absolute event starts tomorrow, but in preparation the staff are building something like a tent village.

There’s a lot of attendees who can’t wait for the opening day, huh. There’s even food stalls for them, they’re already making merry.  

Fufu. I don’t dislike this kind of atmosphere. What fine weather♪

**Jun**: Umm, we didn’t have anything else to do, so we came with you like you asked us to. What kind of clues are supposed to be here\~?

**NEGI**: “Before getting into that, how much do you two know about Absolute?”

**Jun**: Uh. I only know whatever I can look up about it online~, it’s an event people in Japan aren’t really familiar with, though.

Just in case, I did a bit of research before taking this job, but I don’t know much about it.

**Hiyori**: Last time, we were just guests and enjoyed the event. Generally, our knowledge is more or less the same as that of the average person.

Absolute is the world’s biggest idol festival, held in the WNW district of Detroit, Michigan three times a year.

Its catchphrase was, and still is, “Fanatic Festival.”

**Jun**: Haha. That unsettling slogan is the same as always~.

**NEGI**: “Yes. I’m not sure why it’s described like that.

But you see, from the general public, who only know respectable music’s, point of view, Absolute’s music is—

Maybe the so-called idols look fanatic to them?

I feel like the performers are competing for the sake of how much money they can make from flashy performances rather than for the music itself.

Perhaps it feels more like a circus than a concert?”

**Jun**: It was cool when we watched the performances as guests too~. A performer was shot by a machine gun out of nowhere, fell to the ground, and then rose from the dead like a zombie.

**NEGI**: “Ahaha.”

**Hiyori**: Ahh, that also happened…… Also, you mentioned that Shaka-san is religious, so maybe that’s why he was acting like a scene ripped right out of a myth.

Suddenly, without any warning, a crack appeared on the floor of the venue, and a shining Shaka-san rose up from the depths. It was super surprising, y’know.

Just like that, Shaka-san was floating in the air, shining like the sun, and singing something that sounded like an up-beat hymn.

**NEGI**: “With a group of angels. By the way, I don’t know which concert you all saw, but in the last performance, I also got to silently play the role of one of those angels.

Since I had become personal friends with Shaka-san, he asked me to appear in something.

I also had some free time and wanted to sing, so I decided to appear, but, honestly, I don’t think I’ll ever do it again.

I don’t know why, but it was scary because I was floating, not because I was suspended by wires. It felt like I was weightless, and it was hard for me to control my posture.”

**Jun**: I was more concerned about the cracks in the ground. That kind of thing is a natural phenomenon, so how did they cause that kind of situation\~?

**NEGI**: “I’m not sure, but if you save up enough money, you can do most anything, right?”

**Jun**: It cost an absurd amount of money, huh\~…… Is that kind of thing profitable?

**NEGI**: “Maybe so. You probably know this, but in Absolute, unlike the ES drefes system, the winners and losers are determined solely by how much money they receive from the attendees.

It’s what you would call tipping. People who watch the performance either live or through broadcasting can spend as much money as they’d like on their favorite performers.”

**Hiyori**: And so, it feels like the performer who made the most money was the winner.

**NEGI**: “Yes. And the money earned from doing so goes directly to the performer’s bank account.

No matter how much you spend on production, if the results are good then you can make a decent profit, right?

But in recent years, the productions have become increasingly flashy, so it probably costs a lot more money. So, most of the performers are probably in debt.

I heard that every year, a number of people ruin their lives because of this. 

No matter if you win or lose, it’ll lead to your own destruction. But even so, every year, idiots will gather and do stupid things.

That’s why it’s called the ‘Fanatic Festival.’”

(Location: Michigan Townscape)

**Jun**: Haaah\~…… The world is way too confusing.

**NEGI**: “It’s relatively common in this country. Absolute is the flashier one, but there are others where people hit each other with cars, and I heard that there are a lot of abandoned cars once the competition’s over.”

**Hiyori**: What would possess people to do that?

**NEGI**: “It’s insane. But that’s what makes it so interesting, you see.

Art can only be born from madness, I guess.”

**Hiyori**: Madness, huuh. We don’t have enough of that, do we?

**Jun**: It’s true that we always perform perfectly according to Ibara’s carefully thought out plans.

And that’s why unexpected things rarely happen.

But with Ibara, I’d like to see him break out of his shell and spread his wings, rather than staying stuck in his own expectations.

**Hiyori**: Ibara, even though he gets angry when we act unexpectedly and selfishly.

**Jun**: Ahaha. If he found out we’re walking around outside like this, he’d probably get angry.

**Hiyori**: Probably. I hate Ibara’s lectures since he just drones on and on and on, so let’s get this all settled before he finds out.

NEGI-chan. You said there might be clues at this Absolute venue—

**NEGI**: “I don’t have any proof though. The performers in Absolute essentially work individually, unlike ES with its unit system.”

**Hiyori**: The super idols that have already become obsolete in Japan are still mainstream, huh.

**NEGI**: “Yes. The same goes for Shaka, who, officially, is working as an individual.

But in reality, many staff members work together to create the stage— including a large number of backup dancers and a special effects team.”

**Hiyori**: It’s the same way in Japan. Behind the sparkling, shining sun, there’s a large number of staff supporting us.

**NEGI**: “Yes. And talented people are in high demand everywhere, and some of them work with Shaka while also helping other performers.

But then, Shaka disappeared. But not all of the people involved with him disappeared with him.

There’s a chance that one of them may know where Shaka is.

It’s a classic trope in mystery novels, it’s not that easy to erase a human being from existence.

There must be an accomplice who is guiding him or acting as a diversion in order to mislead the investigation.”

**Hiyori**: So the idea is to figure out Shaka-san’s whereabouts from that perspective.

However, since we don’t know who is involved in this incident, it seems like it’s going to be a pain to go around asking questions.

**NEGI**: “That’s true. But I know quite a bit about Shaka’s friendships, so I have a good idea of who it may be.

From here on out, I’m going to contact each of these people and ask them about it.

It’s straightforward work and disheartening, but I can’t think of anything else I can do right now.”

**Jun**: The fortress-like place where Shaka-san was being protected is on high alert.

It had an atmosphere that I couldn’t even get close to\~. On-site verification isn’t possible, either.

**Hiyori**: I don’t think we would be able to find any clues even if we inspected the scene, no matter if we were detectives or not.

We just have to try our best and do everything we can.

I don’t really like that kind of uncouth stuff.

It can’t be helped, though. It’s for Nagisa-kun’s sake.

**Jun**: Well, we still don’t know whether Nagi-senpai has something to do with Shaka-san’s disappearance, y’know~. He could be back at the hotel by now.

He was just taking a morning walk, or something. Like he usually does, in his carefree way.

**Hiyori**: Yeah. It would’ve been nice if it had been a “we didn’t know that and had just been wandering every which way of our own accord” kind of disappointing punchline.

However, until we reach the truth, we can’t be optimistic.

**Jun**: Gotcha. At worst, Nagi-senpai’s life is at risk.

**NEGI**: “I agree. Let’s do our best. And for that reason, I need your cooperation.”

**Jun**: But we’ve said it a bunch of times already, we’re not detectives or anything, y’know\~? Can we even be of any use?

**NEGI**: “But you guys are performing in Absolute, right? If you didn’t have that position, we wouldn’t be able to enter the staff’s tent village.

See, it would be a problem if fans could come in without permission and come in contact with the performers and staff.

This city is usually unsafe, so these kinds of security measures have been put in place.”

**Hiyori**: I see. So we’re like key cards necessary to enter areas that are normally off-limits to outsiders.

**NEGI**: “Something like that. Of course, to you there’s basically only foreigners here, so they don’t understand Japanese—

I’ll be the one to interrogate any shady people.”

**Hiyori**: I can also speak English to some extent since it’s necessary for socializing.

**Jun**: …… I don’t think I’ll be too useful in that area, so I’ll keep an eye on our surroundings, okay\~?

**NEGI**: “Alright. Then, just like that—

I’ll get to the dirty work. I can’t stand having the biggest idols in ES do something like that♪”

(Location: Secret Religious Facility)

(At the same time. Secret religious facility underneath the WNW district.)

**Shaka**: “Hey, brother, do you remember the circumstances of when you were born?

Do you know who you are, and where you came from?”

**Nagisa**: …… No.

…… Father passed away without telling me anything of the sort.

…… That’s why even now, I’m still constantly searching for ‘that’.

…… About what I am.

…… I felt like if I were to become the finest idol like Father had wished for, I would be able to touch upon even the edges of the answer to that.

…… But. That should be unnecessary since you seem to know what I am.

…… You called me brother, didn’t you, Shaka-san.

…… Are you saying that you and I are siblings properly connected by blood?

**Shaka**: “………”

**Nagisa**: ……The last time we went to the United States, we saw you sing on the stage of Absolute.

…… So that strange feeling, that discomfort I felt at the time was, in other words, a sense of identification that came from that sort of blood connection.

**Shaka**: “Unfortunately I can’t answer that question with either YES or NO.

I don’t know that much either. Just like the God who behaved like your guardian(1), Priest who created and controlled me had passed away without telling me anything important.”

**Nagisa**: …… Is that so. In that case, I feel a little regret, like I should not have got rid of him.

**Shaka**: “I want to thank you for a job truly well done in that regard.

He was a monster. He was someone who should have been suppressed. He was a devil who had contorted and crushed countless people’s lives, including me and NEGI-chan.

Even with conjecture, I can’t really say what that man’s objective was. He seemed to be earnestly imitating the way of life of the God in the religious faith he followed, though. 

So what did he ultimately want to do? Did he just want to replace God, or did he want to surpass God—

I don’t know the actual truth. Everything is a mystery; it’s all been buried in the darkness.”

**Nagisa**: ………

**Shaka**: “However, I can say this. Priest and the God he believed in had a distinct difference; Priest had been in pursuit of eternal life.”

**Nagisa**: …… From time immemorial, that’s what conquering champions had earnestly sought after.

…… No. In a way, it’s the greatest wish(2) of all mankind.

…… That is to say, to not want to die and wanting to live.

**Shaka**: “That’s true. I’m searching for that too. If possible, I just want to forever enjoy a free, fun life.

However. My life was dominated by Priest.

I was simply a pawn for Priest to use to achieve his ambitions. I was a money-making device used to gather the profits required for that.”
image

**Nagisa**: …… I wonder if it was the same for me too.

…… Was the reason father wanted me to become an idol because he wanted me to become a profitable existence just like you are?

**Shaka**: “Unlike you, I don’t really know much about God, so I can’t say for certain.

I’d like to tell you that it’s not like that. That your father, God, loved idols, unlike Priest. (3)

I don’t think you’re just a tool for making money, from what I can infer about him from what I heard in stories.

He loved idols. So he probably genuinely just wanted you to be what he loved.

I’m envious of you, brother.”

**Nagisa**: ………

**Shaka**: “I, and possibly you too, am a ‘Perfect human’ that one could not even dream of having been brought into being (4) unless by means of state of the art occult science. 

I’m an artificial human, whose countless consolidated souls of geniuses dwell in this body possessing the best genes.

Perhaps I didn’t have proper parents, and was born (4) from a test tube.

This means that I’m a homunculus born(4) by means of alchemy. Fufu.

You might be thinking that these are just the thoughtless words of someone with a mental illness, brother. I don’t think I’m quite sane anymore either—— so I’d like you to take what I said with a grain of salt.

At the very least, I grew up being told that I was that sort of being.

That I, the most perfect human created(4) by God, was created(4) through the same technology that created Ran Nagisa.

Of course Priest admired God, took over his position and replaced him, but in the end he was still a worthless human who could not become God.

That technology probably wasn’t perfect. In the end, I can’t be anything more than an inferior copy of you.”

**Nagisa**: …… This might not be enough of a consolation. But thinking that a copy is inferior to the original is a superficial way of thinking.

…… If we’re to speak from the point of view of biology, the later generation of seeds are more excellent. It can adapt to it’s environment better, with better survival. A strong living being. 

…… In fact, you’re Absolute’s six-times consecutive champion. You’re said to be the world’s best idol.

…… After all, you have better reputation than me, who is just borrowing Ibara’s words to pretend to be a king of the hill domestically.

…… You’re higher ranked than me beyond any comparison.

…… The moment I first saw you, a feeling that was difficult to describe was born(4) inside of me.

…… When I saw you singing and dancing on stage, what arose inside of me was probably a sense of defeat and a sense of inferiority, in other words it was jealousy.

…… You were the first to have given me that sort of feeling since I was born, O, world’s best idol.

**Shaka**: “You’re kind, huh.

That’s exactly why I’m jealous; you grew up being loved.

So you can care about others. You’re able to want to wipe away that grief.

That’s quite difficult for someone like me, people who won’t be able to live if we don’t exert ourselves to the fullest.”

**Nagisa**: ………

**Shaka**: “I’m the world’s best idol? How absurd!

In Absolute, the performer who can get the most tips wins. It’s not the most brilliant or talented idol who wins, but the idol who earns the most money.

Furthermore, Priest, who made me, had an enormous amount of power and money.

I continued to win Absolute simply because that Priest who had more money compared to anyone else, continued to pour money into me.

It was definitely not due to my abilities.

I’m the minion of the devil, I’m a false messiah who misleads the people while slurping on their lifeblood! I can’t help but hate, *hate* the me who does that! 

Brother! Please help me…….! I can’t stand being myself anymore!”

(Location: Inside Luxury Car)

(Reminiscence. Right after everyone in Eden attended Absolute, inside a rental car driving through an American town.)

**Nagisa**: ………

**Hiyori**: ………

**Jun**: (…… Th-The vibes are so off!

Well, I guess it can’t be helped~, we had heard that Absolute is the biggest idol festival in the world but—

I mean seriously, it was all just a bunch of flashy, crazy performances that I almost can’t believe it was real. If I had seen it while sick, I might’ve fallen asleep.

Those two seniors, they’re usually composed all the time, but……

Maybe they were overwhelmed, or they’re thinking about something, but they’ve been quiet this whole time, haven’t they~?)

**Ibara**: W-Well, that was certainly an impressive performance!

**Jun**: (Dang! Saegusa-kun, are you trying to fix the vibes by starting a conversation!?

I’m spared! I’m already worn out from enjoying the festivities for so long.

If I had to endure these bad vibes indefinitely, then I’ll probably die from stress, y’know!?)

**Ibara**: Especially the reigning champion Shaka-shi, whose win would make this his second, or rather his third, consecutive victory. His performance was beyond anything one could imagine—

**Nagisa**: …… Sorry. I hope you aren’t talking to me, since I don’t have the energy to respond.

…… I, may be a bit sick.

**Ibara**: A-Ah! I sincerely apologize for not being considerate enough, Your Excellency! Excuse me, driver, could you please slow down to lessen the shaking—

**Nagisa**: …… No, the speed of the car is fine.

…… I can’t express it well, but ever since watching Absolute, I’ve felt a strange sensation swirling in me.

…… I’m not used to it, I don’t know what to do, and I feel bad.

**Hiyori**: Aha. It’s been a while since Nagisa-kun felt like this.

Immediately after he came to live with me, he often seemed depressed and held his head low. Because of that, I thought he was a sickly child for a while.

And then when we did a medical checkup on him, it turned out he was perfectly healthy, and the doctor praised him for his “perfect” health. Aha, I was deceived.

**Nagisa**: …… Sorry. I didn’t mean to deceive you.

**Hiyori**: You don’t have to apologize for being healthy! I just misunderstood you, and isn’t that disrespectful to the poor sickly children of the world for me to do?

**Nagisa**: …… Are you talking about Eichi-kun?

**Hiyori**: Huh? I won’t have anything to do with that for the rest of my life! What foul weather! 

**Nagisa**: …… I wonder, what is he doing these days? Is he still in the hospital?

**Hiyori**: Ah, ah, it makes me feel sick so stop talking about that, stop it! How about we talk about something more fun, Nagisa-kun?

**Jun**: (…… Haah, yay. I don’t really understand what happened, but the vibes have changed. When this person starts talking, any bad vibes get blown right away\~♪

I seriously respect that kind of thing.

I’m gloomy, yknow~…… Well, I can’t help it that much since I didn’t have a bright and enjoyable childhood.)

**Hiyori**: —It’ll all be alright, Jun-kun.

**Jun**: Huh?

**Hiyori**: From now on, thanks to me of course, you’ll be able to experience a ton more fun and cheerful events!

How fortunate for you! That you were able to have met me!

**Jun**: Haah…… Well, I have actually gained some valuable experience, y’know~?

**Ibara**: Yes. Let’s use every experience as sustenance to become even more powerful!

We are still developing. So, let’s eat a lot, train a lot, learn a lot, and become an entity that can never be beat!

Someday, we’ll become so powerful that the people who performed in Absolute will get sick at the sight of us!

**Hiyori**: Ahaha. If you can talk our ears off about it like that, then there’s no need to worry.

Honestly, I hate stinky, sweaty, overly competitive people like that.

But hey, it’s not a bad thing to be surprised sometimes. It’s exactly why I was intimidated so many times while watching the performances at Absolute.

If I keep acting scared and shrink away, the Tomoe name will be stained.

Well, I’m just the carefree second son who doesn’t have any responsibilities♪

**Ibara**: Yes, that’s the spirit! Once we return to Japan, I shall put together a training regiment that will help us grow with maximum efficiency! We must also prepare for our debut!

Things are getting quite busy~! It’s exciting isn’t it, everyone!

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu. Yes, thanks to you, I feel like the darkness in my heart is fading away.

…… Always, in order to overcome despair, we need a shining hope like the one you showed me.

(Location: Gatekeeper’s Office)

(End of reminiscence, present day. The day after the world’s number one idol Shaka’s disappearance.)

(The day of the Absolute event. Gatekeeper’s office in the slum area.)

**Ibara**: ………

**Gatekeeper**: —Oy. Don’t carelessly display yer cutesy sleeping face, wake up, boy.

It’s morning.

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/9p6u0phn.png">

**Ibara**: …… Ah, my apologies. I was determined to work through the night, but it seems that I’ve ingrained a well-regulated habit into my lifestyle.

When the hour turns to bedtime, I naturally fall asleep.

**Gatekeeper**: That’s not a bad thing. Our younger guys and the lot get so obsessed with the nightlife that their lifestyle gets messed up,  there are even those who become insomniacs because they’re scared of enemy attacks. 

Good for yer, yer living a peaceful life that lets yer sleep without a care.

**Ibara**: Thanks. It’s the peaceful life I’ve obtained with my own hands after getting out of a shitty environment.

**Gatekeeper**: Ah, I’m jealous— is not something I’m thinking about, but I do find it very interesting. If yer ask me, yer brats look like those Hobbits-chan living in the world of The Lord of The Rings.

What yer thinking about, what yer talking about are all a mystery to me. That’s why it’s interesting.

**Ibara**: …… What’s the situation?

**Gatekeeper**: Unfortunately, it’s not in our favour. There’s the fact that I’m not an expert at finding people, but it’s pathetic to the point that we can’t find even a single clue.

Well, it can’t be helped. This isn’t my own turf, it’s simply my hunting grounds; where I make money. It’s completely different from looking for lost coins in your own room. 

This was originally that guy Priest’s turf. Though I said that, it seems since that guy’s vanished, currently his subordinates are in chaos that they don’t even have the leeway to pay attention to us.

That’s why we’re able to search all around all we want. Till now, we haven’t been able to get a lead on either Shaka or the child of God, Nagisa-sama.

Wonder what’s happenin, there’s no way a human can just disappear like smoke.

**Ibara**: …… Shaka-shi was originally cultivated by Priest as a money tree, and was treated as Priest’s property, wasn’t he.

**Gatekeeper**: Yeah. Something that important disappeared, Priest’s subordinates must be in a frenzy looking for him all over the place.

Several times, I’ve received reports about skirmishes with my troops.

**Ibara**: Since our goal’s the same, can’t we just get along and look for Shaka-shi?

**Gatekeeper**: Don’t say stupid things, sworn enemies joining hands so they could achieve a shared goal is just a fairy tale.

We’re the sort of guys who like to pull on each other’s legs, boy.

Even if yer ass caught on fire, ya gotta diligently set yer opponent’s only set of clothes on fire using a match. That way, you’ll be satisfied even if yer burned to death.

I think it’ll be better if the opponent dies first, and then yer can laugh in their face as they die. I won’t ask them to fight against the fire together even if I die.

**Ibara**: Such troublesome living creatures. It’d be a great help if such idiots minimise passing on their genes as much as possible.

**Gatekeeper**: Well, they’ll probably eventually crush each other to death. Yer never know.

This world that’s made by the real God is well made. It’s the survival of the fittest.

**Ibara**: Yes. I’m doing my very best to continue surviving as well.

Let’s sort out the situation. The first premise; Shaka-shi is a celebrity. Especially during Absolute season, the audience would march in on this district—

If he were to walk in the area aimlessly, he’ll be spotted by a fan five seconds in and cause a commotion.

However, as of now, he remains a missing person. Even including SNS, eyewitness reports of Shaka-shi are nonexistent.

But since Shaka-shi’s disappearance has been spread by careless media and it’s spreading like wildfire, there’s a mountain of false information about his whereabouts.

Just in case, I wasted a whole day yesterday just to check every one of those out one by one. And unfortunately, the result was; everything was a hit and miss.

I have spread my net over trains and buses and even planes, but everything was a miss. I wasn’t able to get any substantial information at all.

I wouldn’t know, but is Shaka-shi an invisible man or something?

**Gatekeeper**: If that’s the case, you can make money with that technology.

**Ibara**: Err. I was joking. Using this information for conjecture, Shaka-shi is isolated in a secret passage where the public eye cannot follow him— no, he’s probably confined there.

Or maybe he’s been taken apart(1), and is currently lined up in some butcher’s somewhere.

**Gatekeeper**: I’ll assume that’s also a joke, but if there’s a casualty of  that kind of manner in “our turf”, the information will without fail reach us.

Disposing of a dead body is not easy for an amateur, so if they ask for help from a pro, we’ll definitely hear about it.

Don’t worry, the child of God is still alive.

<br>

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/i67p1dwd.png">

(Location: Gatekeeper’s Office)

**Ibara**: Indeed. I believe that His Excellency is alive.

That person is so obedient that there is no way he would die without my express permission, and I have no such script prepared for him.

However. The reason why His Excellency disappeared at the same time as Shaka-shi is currently unknown, so we should consider all possibilities.

And compared to Shaka-shi, His Excellency is not well known by the locals. He’s no different than the average person out there.

If His Excellency were to be abducted at the same time as Shaka-shi, then it would be easy to treat him as if he were of little importance.

If the abductors are on the run, then it’s obvious that someone of His Excellency’s tall stature would be in their way.

We have to find His Excellency before he’s crudely “disposed” of by that person.

**Gatekeeper**: Abductor? Is there someone yer have in mind?

**Ibara**: It’s just a guess. It’s unlikely that his Excellency disappeared of his own volition, so it’s reasonable to assume that he’s been abducted by someone.

Uncle, I am considering the possibility that Shaka-shi has kidnapped His Excellency.

**Gatekeeper**: Oh? So the theory is that that asshole Shaka, who we’ve thought was abducted with him, was actually the culprit. How fun, it feels like I’m reading a mystery novel. 

**Ibara**: You probably haven’t read any, since you’re fairly busy, Uncle.

In any case, Shaka-shi can be said to be the most important person to Priest, or rather, to the whole WNW district. Naturally, the more important you are, the “more you can do.”

Shaka-shi made full use of his authority and abducted His Excellency from the hotel where the security was supposed to be strict. And even now, he’s keeping him confined somewhere—

So, where are they? What’s the purpose of this?

That’s what I’m thinking about right now.

**Gatekeeper**: …… Yesterday, we searched every possible place above ground. So all that’s left is the inside of buildings… and underground.

**Ibara**: Underground?

**Gatekeeper**: There are countless underground tunnels in the area. It’s a hotbed for the homeless, and a convenient loophole for us to work in.

It’s a place where those in the shadows live. But of course, as an outsider, I can’t keep everything under surveillance.

If we cause problems underground, where there’s no laws or ethics, you’ll end up caught in a “landslide” and the people with a claim over the area will rip you to pieces and eat yer for dinner. Which is why I hadn’t mentioned it yesterday—

If they were found in a normal place aboveground then everything would be fine.

However, this isn’t the kind of situation where I can say that. Absolute will begin soon, and if we don’t catch that asshole and drag him onto the stage before then, there will be an uproar.

Absolute and the gambling den will break down, and, if we aren’t careful, we’ll lose a major source of income forever.

**Ibara**: That hardly compares to our current issue. And it would even serve you right, I think. However, I don’t really want to keep having my plans messed up like this.

Organize as many people as you can and send out a search party for His Excellency. Knock on every door you see, and destroy everything underground—

We will find His Excellency, who’s most likely imprisoned somewhere there.

**Gatekeeper**: Heard. Good grief, it’s not even the gold rush era but we’re getting muddy and crawling into holes. (1)

—

**Ibara**: ……? What is it, Uncle?

**Gatekeeper**: Shit. Just now, I realized something bad.

I felt so sorry for you, that I sent my best men to look for Shaka and Nagisa-sama. I didn’t even have time to sleep and I’ve mobilized all my subordinates.

In other words…… You understand, don’t you, boy?

**Ibara**: …… We’re stretched thin here without enough security forces!

**Gatekeeper**: Ahh, now would be the perfect time to attack me!

Get yer head down, boy! I heard the sound of the hammer, they’re going to shoot at us!

**Ibara**: Ahh seriously, this is why I hate gun politics! I keep bees in my office, but I don’t want it to turn into a beehive, got it!?

<br>

TL NOTES:

(Location: Secret Religious Facility)

(At the same time. The place where Nagisa is being confined in, inside the secret religious facility underneath the WNW district )

**Nagisa**: (………?

…… I can hear from somewhere far away, a booming sound, like the sound of fireworks.

…… Does that mean that Absolute’s already begun?

…… That’s troubling. Everyone must be worried about my sudden disappearance.

…… I have to go back. I have to go to where I belong.

…… But, to do that.)

…… Shaka-san.

**Shaka**: “Mm. Have you made up your mind, brother?

If so, let me hear your answer.

How about it, brother? Would you become Shaka in my place from now on, just like I desired?”

**Nagisa**: ………

**Shaka**: “You just have to answer with YES.

With that, all of me will be yours. Even wealth, fame, anything and everything.

With just that, you will become the world’s number one idol from today onwards.”

**Nagisa**: …… You don’t have to go out of your way to give it away.

…… I plan to reach “there” with my own strength sooner or later.

…… Together with Ibara, with Hiyori-kun and Jun, I will become “that”.

**Shaka**: “Children with a future, how nice. It smells naive but I don’t hate it.

But. You don’t get it, Brother. It’s best if I could get your consent, but I can force you too.”

**Nagisa**: ………

**Shaka**: “I have the technique for it. Though I won’t say it’s as top-class as Priest or his successor NEGI-chan.

I was born(1) as a perfect human too. I have all sorts of talents.

By observing it closely many times, it’s like I’ve experienced it myself, I stole their ‘turning into someone else’ technique to a certain degree. 

By utilising that, it’s possible to make your appearance look “the same” as me.

Of course, by doing that, only your appearance will change. Even I still can’t touch upon your heart.

However, because no one could touch or see your heart, no matter how much you insist that “I’m not Shaka”, it’ll be meaningless.

I’ll make full use of my personal connections to make a lot of people give out false testimonies. They’ll say that you are Shaka.

That will be the “correct answer” for the people.

No matter how much you scream that you are Ran Nagisa, it’ll be useless. I’ll make it become a lie.

Do you know what being the only normal person in a world with only lunatics is called?”

**Nagisa**: …… A lunatic.

**Shaka**: “Indeed. Welcome to the village of liars.

You can rest assured. In any case, nobody would be interested in something like your innermost heart.

The results would be bought with Priest’s money. The person himself is no longer with us, but his subordinates will always be.

You can exist as the world’s number one idol for eternity. With that, you can gain money beyond what you can use, and you can live in happiness.”

**Nagisa**: …… If that sort of life is a proper happiness.

…… I wonder why you would loath it and try to foist it on me.

…… I suppose it’s because it’s so painful that it’s unbearable, isn’t it, Shaka-san.

**Shaka**: “Don’t call me Shaka.

I am, I am, that’s wrong, I didn’t want to be this me.

I, I liked singing. I liked dancing alongside singing too.

When they got happy when they saw that; I loved it.”

**Nagisa**: …… Me too, you see.

**Shaka**: “But is that really my own will? It’s not because my genes made me be like that?

That’s how I was made! I was created(1) to become the world’s number one idol!

If I let the fate that was decided before I was born(1) guide me, am I not just single-mindedly behaving according to someone else’s wishes?

Even this heart! What if it’s a product(2) that was prepared by someone beforehand.

I am, what am I supposed to, what I should I have faith(4) in?

I, I am…… Who?

Who am I? What am I? Even though I am myself and yet not me to myself!?”

**Nagisa**: (…… It’s no use. I don’t really want to use expressions of this sort, but Shaka-san is becoming crazy. (3)

…… To be burdened with the fate of being called the “world’s number one idol” by others, he can no longer support himself.

…… Nevertheless. In order to preserve his own self ego(5), in order to shake himself free from that fate, he’s attempting to foist the burden he’s always been carrying onto me.

…… To that end, Shaka-san kidnapped me.

…… So that he could give to me, who is the same living being as himself, the position that he’s been burdened with.

…… Shaka-san is at his limit. It seems that currently he’s able to withstand it somehow, but before long, he won’t be able to bear it anymore.

…… Even if by force, he’s pushing onto me the “me” that he said he couldn’t help but hate.

…… I wonder if I should accept that. So that I could survive here.

…… But. At that moment, I will, Ran Nagisa will be erased from this world.

…… Shaka-san is serious. It seems he will make full use of all of that he’s built up so that he would make it that I would be called Shaka-san.

It seems they will spread the news that that is the “truth” to the world, to society.

…… My appearance will be forcibly changed too and I suppose I will lose this form.

…… I will be someone who is no longer me.

…… I will no longer be the me who is loved, was loved by Hiyori-kun and the rest.

…… That’s scary.

…… Even just imagining it is very, very scary.)

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/9a8w5b7z.png">

(…… Ah, but, I’m just a little bit happy.

…… When Father passed, I thought I had lost just about everything.

…… However. The current me has so many important things I hold dear(6).)

(Location: Luxury Hotel (Guest Room))

(At the same time. Eden’s accommodations, in a luxury hotel room)

**NEGI**: “Good mo\~rnin’, everyone♪

Did you get enough sleep last night? C’mon, today let’s also do our best to search—”

**Jun**: \~……♪

**Hiyori**: \~……♪

**NEGI**: “Ah, okay. Sorry. You two are in the middle of something.

Let me just say, it’s okay.

I’m not all that prejudiced and this country tends to treat ‘these kinds of relationships’ with a lotta respect these days.”

**Jun**: These kinds of relationships– what kind of relationship are you talking about……?

I was just, well, Ohiisan couldn’t sleep because he was worried about Nagi-senpai, so I had him lay his head on my lap while I sang him a lullaby is all.

**NEGI**: “Sure. You should know that at first glance that doesn’t look anything like a normal friendship, okay? You don’t want to be misunderstood, right?

Or maybe— I didn’t misunderstand anything after all?

My heart’s beating out of my chest. I mean, it’s strangely embarrassing to see someone you know doing ‘something like that’, y’know.”

**Jun**: That’s why I’ve been tryin’ to figure out what you’re even talking about~?

More importantly, sorry you had to come all this way to pick us up. We’ll be ready in a sec, so please wait a moment.

**NEGI**: “Alright. I’ll be waiting.

…… The preparation is just that, isn’t it? Preparing to search for that Ran Nagisa person and Shaka-san, right?

Absolute is going to start in a few hours, but is that really okay? You guys are supposed to be performing, right?”

**Jun**: Well, being in Absolute is also somethin’ we were asked to do, so I don’t think we can just ignore it, right~?

It’s unavoidable though, the four of us are Eden.

We were asked to perform as Eden, not Eve, so we can’t just go and stand on stage like that.

Now, more than anything else, finding and protecting Nagi-senpai is our top priority.

Isn’t that right, Ohiisan? Why have you been quiet for a while? Usually, you yap constantly whenever I leave your side, did you fall asleep or somethin’?

**Hiyori**: …… I’m just embarrassed. Yes, I’ve said it a number of times before, but NEGI-chan, you really should learn to knock properly before you enter a room.

**NEGI**: “I’m reflecting on it. How awkward. It’s something I feel bad about.”

**Jun**: I’m sure you’re desperate to find that Shaka guy, so I can appreciate your enthusiasm~?

**Hiyori**: That’s right. …… I hadn’t asked before but, NEGI-chan, what kind of relationship do you have with Shaka-san? You’re quite desperate for someone who’s just his friend?

**NEGI**: “Hm~? Nope, we’re just friends, you see?

Maybe I’m projecting onto him a little, though. That person, he’s also a victim of my shitty father.

I think I’m cute, after all.

It’s embarrassing. I intended to sing for someone else’s sake, but in the end I was just singing for myself.”

**Hiyori**: I also think I’m the cutest person in the universe!

**Jun**: No one said anything about you?

**Hiyori**: Correct. The most important thing to everyone is themselves. Movies and novels move me to tears exactly because I compare myself to them and project onto them.

If someone were to put others before themselves, don’t you think they have a screw loose somewhere?

**Jun**: Ohiisan, are you talking about yourself?

**Hiyori**: I always put myself first, don’t I?

**Jun**: Haha. Wow, maybe people will believe that.

**NEGI**: “……? I don’t know what’s going on but, hurry up and get ready, alright?

We don’t have any time left. If we don’t find Shaka-san and stick him on stage by the time Absolute starts, there’ll be a riot if we aren’t careful.

Also, I’m sure my shitty father’s remaining subordinates will punish Shaka-san if he caused a huge loss like that.

That person’s chances of surviving have almost vanished into thin air.

If that becomes the case, then I won’t be able to find him ever again, so I can only hope that he escapes to somewhere safe.”

**Hiyori**: It’d be troublesome if we could never find him again! I don’t really care about Shaka-san, but we absolutely have to find Nagisa-kun!

I’m sure right this very moment he’s crying because he’s sad that I’m not there! Ah, I want to hug him!

That’s why yesterday I said we shouldn’t stop the search and continue it through the night! If we had done that, then by now—

**NEGI**: “By now our completely transformed bodies might have been discovered by the local garbage collectors?

I told you, didn’t I? This place is usually unsafe. To put it plainly, in peaceful Japan, “bad public safety” is completely different from here.

We should have gone back to this relatively safe hotel for the night. I can bet all my money that I made the right call on that. I don’t have much savings, though.”

## 6

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/4g9kucqp.png">

(Location: Luxury Hotel (Guest Room))

**Hiyori**: Uuu~……I’ll trust you, a local, with your opinion on that matter. I can’t help always being restless though.

But! It’s much safer when the Sun’s still high in the sky compared to the night, right?

**NEGI**: “Mm. Let’s use that time as much as possible to find those two who are missing.

Thankfully within yesterday, we were able to narrow down the possibilities to a certain point. As a result of interviewing a lot of witnesses who were surrounded, a strange fact emerged.”

**Jun**: I don’t really know about Nagi-senpai, but the possibility that Shaka-san’s disappearance was a ruse came out, huh~?

**Hiyori**: In the end it’s still nothing more than a possibility, though. Shaka-san, who was supposed to have disappeared, seems to have been confirmed to be appearing in Absolute today somehow. 

**Jun**: They just made it look like he’s disappeared, but the truth is, it was all staged, huh~

Then he’ll appear in front of the disappointed fans going surpr~ise or something?

**NEGI**: “We don’t know, though. There’s still the possibility that everything is misinformation that’s nothing more than a simple rumour. Besides, we don’t understand why Ran Nagisa-san disappeared with him.”

**Hiyori**: At least, the Staff-san’s been preparing hard for it.

It seems that detailed instructions for stuff like production have been sent out from Shaka-san.

But we don’t know if the Shaka-san who sent out the instructions is the real deal or if it’s just someone else stealing his identity—

**NEGI**: “At least that person knows something about Shaka-san.”

**Jun**: Yes. If we head in that direction, the best that could happen is finding Shaka-san himself— but if not, we’ll probably get clues of some kind. 

**Hiyori**: It feels like a step forward from being at a total loss.

**Jun**: Yes. Also just in case, I asked for something unreasonable and borrowed the smartphone that Shaka-san would contact Staff-san on.

But it seems like the other side hides the caller ID, even if our side tries to take a call, it looks impossible.

There’s a high chance this smartphone will receive contact from that Shaka-san-like person.

**NEGI**: “Shaka-san is quite high strung and tends to give minute instructions for the production and stuff. He’ll definitely call before performance time.”

**Jun**: That sorta thinking’s the reason we borrowed this smartphone. It’s a valuable clue, so we can’t miss it.

**Hiyori**: We forcibly borrowed it by piling up money for it. I relied on my folks back home for that.

**Jun**: It does help to have rich relatives. They can smack down a stack of bills when you’re in trouble, it’s the best\~♪

After this, let’s get this smartphone we got to that guy Ibara who knows a lot about stuff like this to analyse it.

If it all goes well, we can pinpoint the source of the phone transmission, and we should be able to confirm the whereabouts of Shaka-san, or maybe whoever the person pretending to be him is.

**Hiyori**: If we’ve decided, let’s hurry and head to where Ibara is. Not being able to move around at night gets me anxious. Even though we managed to get our hands on a clue, we can’t move forward further than—

**Jun**: Cause getting the smartphone was the unexpected endgame for the witness interviews\~?

**Hiyori**: It was bad timing and bad luck…… You know where Ibara could be at, right, NEGI-chan?

**NEGI**: “Yep. There’s only one of Uncle’s base of operations in this district.

And besides, that’s the most convenient place. I think even right now, Uncle is taking command of the search for Shaka-san and them over there.

That kid called Saegusa Ibara is probably there with him too.”

**Jun**: K then, let’s head on over right now. Haha, when it gets out that we’ve been acting on our own— that guy’s probably gonna be angrily nagging at us though♪

**Hiyori**: It’s nothing to be mad at! Nagisa-kun’s safety is of utmost importance!

**Jun**: Haha. Nagi-senpai’s gonna say ‘Hiyori-kun’s safety is of utmost importance!’ too when he knows we’ve been reckless\~

**Hiyori**: It’s ten thousand times better to be scolded than to never meet ever again! What foul weather! Stop playing around and let’s go to where Ibara is right now—

**NEGI**: “………”

**Hiyori**: ……? What’s wrong, NEGI-chan? We’re all done preparing, so hurry and lead us to where Ibara is.

**NEGI**: “—Oh no.”

**Hiyori**: Hm? What do you mean ‘oh no’?

**NEGI**: “Look, you can see it from the window from here. Uncle’s office, where we were supposed to be heading to, is around that block, but.

Black smoke that clearly looks like a fire is rising from there.”

**Jun**: Um, in other words, that means…….?

**NEGI**: “—Uncle, might have died.”

## 7

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/qqnz0x7k.png">

(Location: Michigan Townscape)

(10 minutes later. On the street near the scene of the fire.)

**Jun**: GODDAMN!

Damn it, I can’t see anything through the smoke and the crowd!You’re a bit taller than me, right, Ohiisan? Can you see anything~?

**Hiyori**: What do you mean by that? We’re not that different. What, do you have a complex over being shorter than me?

But it seems like no matter where you are in the world, people gather together when something happens. I guess that’s just human nature.

—Ah, Jun-kun, Jun-kun! Your Ohiisan just got a great idea!

You put on a flashy performance right here right now and catch all the onlookers’ attention while I rush onto the scene! How does that sound!?

**Jun**: There’s no “how does that sound!?”, you’re still being super reckless towards me!

**Hiyori**: So are you doing it? Or not?

**Jun**: Aah jeeze, fine I’ll do it okay!? I’ve trained for emergencies like this~!

**Ibara**: —Cough cough, please don’t cause a scene, alright?

I want to make it out of here before anyone notices, so it’ll be troublesome if you stand out.

**Jun**: Ibara!?

**Hiyori**: Are you okay? As expected, snakes really are stubborn animals!

**Ibara**: Um well…… Perhaps Uncle was making fun of me, but he grabbed me by the scruff of my neck and threw me out the window while saying, “I’ll handle things from here.”

We were on the third floor, so I would’ve been seriously injured if I hadn’t used a tree as a cushion.

**NEGI**: “What about Uncle? Is he safe?”

**Ibara**: …… Yes. Probably. If they’re someone who could take his life with an attack of that intensity, then they would have already died many times over.

More importantly, as much as I would like to help Uncle, I don’t wish to bring harm to any of you—

I don’t want to also be picking chestnuts out of a fire. (1)

For now, let’s evacuate! Yes yes, don’t just stand around and get moving!

**Jun**: Haha. As soon as he got out, he started directing us.

**Hiyori**: But that’s exactly what makes him Ibara, isn’t it? What fine weather♪

It’s good that you’re safe. I truly mean it.

**NEGI**: “……  I’ll stay behind. I’m worried about Uncle.”

**Ibara**: I understand how you feel, but it’s no use. If I leave you in a dangerous situation, he’ll not only get angry at me later, but he’ll also kill me.

That’s much more dangerous and terrifying. Do you understand?

**NEGI**: “………

…… Yes. It’s a shame, but a ‘helpless little girl’ won’t be of any use here.”

**Ibara**: I suppose it’s about having the right person in the right place.

…… Even though I told you all to stay at the hotel, it seems His Highness Hiyori and Jun were searching for His Excellency on their own.

It looks like NEGI-shi was taking care of those troublesome people.

**Jun**: Jeez, how did you find out!?

**Ibara**: I was also searching around town for our missing persons, so naturally that kind of information would make its way back to me, right? Is your brain even working properly, Jun?

The tent village at Absolute that you guys were in is considered an untouchable area, so I don’t know what exactly you were doing, but—

………

**Hiyori**: ? Is something wrong, Ibara? You suddenly covered your mouth and stopped talking—Ah, did you get sick from inhaling the smoke?

**Jun**: That’s super bad! Wh-What should we do in this kind of situation? Mouth to mouth……!?

**Ibara**: …… Be quiet for a moment. I think I’ve connected the dots.

**NEGI**: “Wawa? The building is burning down and collapsing, I don’t know what you thought up but how about we talk while we evacuate?”

**Ibara**: Right. I spent a lot of time staring at a map of this town yesterday, so I’ve memorized all the escape routes. So, allow me to guide you.

Everyone, please follow me.

**Jun**: Yes. We’ll always follow Ibara~♪

**Ibara**: Thank you for that. I appreciate your trust.

Truly……

Anyway, I assumed His Excellency and the other one were somewhere inside a building or underground.

However, in summary, the underground is a large place so I thought it would be difficult to comb through it thoroughly.

Unlike my Uncle, Shaka-shi isn’t a professional criminal. His real job is being an idol, after all, so I’m sure he’s feeling very anxious by now—

There should be a number of security measures in place. In other words, the tent village at Absolute that no one can enter.

He’s also likely hidden underground where no one can see him.

**Jun**: A criminal? In hiding? What are you talking about? That Shaka-san guy was kidnapped by someone just like Nagi-senpai was……?

**Hiyori**: Hahaa, does Ibara suspect that Shaka-san is the “true culprit”?

The idea of the person who was thought to be the victim actually turning out to be the culprit has been a staple of mystery plots for a long time.

**Ibara**: When you think about it that way, a lot of things click into place. I think Your Intelligent Highness understands.

**Hiyori**: “If you don’t understand, you’re an idiot,” huh? You’re pretending to sweet talk me so you can stir the pot, huh, Ibara♪  

**Ibara**: Anyway! I’ll be rushing to the Absolute tent village!

Whether the reasoning is correct or not, we can’t just do nothing!

**Jun**: We’re coming too, y’know\~? You’re not going to stop us, are you, Ibara?

**Hiyori**: We did a lot of interrogating at the tent village yesterday.

Since we know the area and have made some acquaintances, I think you’ll be able to search for Nagisa-kun more efficiently than if you were to go in alone, right?

**Ibara**: ………

…… There’s no other way. Now then, please come with me.

I’ll feel more secure if I’m there to monitor you, rather than letting you do whatever you want without my knowledge. Fine.

(Location: Absolute Stage)

(Nearly an hour later. Inside the venue of Absolute.)

**Jun**: Ooh—

Hey, there’s some kinda flashy stage being built~? There wasn’t anything like that here yesterday though?

**Hiyori**: Because it’s almost the time for Absolute to begin. See, there’s already a huge audience, as many as the eyes can see.

**NEGI**: “Thanks to that, the highway was congested, it was a hard time getting to this place…… Ugh, my best set of clothes is drenched in sweat.”

**Ibara**: Yes. It’s just as expected.

However this is difficult, this crowding makes searching for someone—

**Nagisa**: —Are you looking for someone?

**Ibara**: —

Your Excellency.

**Hiyori**: Nagisa-kun!? Eeeeh, we found you even without needing to look for you!

Why are you here? Where have you been and what have you been doing up till now? I’ve been so worried—

………

**Jun**: Ohiisan? What’s going on with you~ What’s up with that face, you’re looking like you’ve seen an alien?

**Hiyori**: ……… Who?

**Jun**: Huh? Who, you said– do you have amnesia or something? No matter which way you look at him, it’s Nagi-senpai……?

No, huh? Now that you’ve mentioned it, something feels weird somewhere……?

**Ibara**: Hmm hmm. I see, so this means he has turned into a different person after undergoing the terrifying experience that is kidnapping. Poor soul.

Did you think that’s what I’d say? Who are you? What you’re doing right now is an infringement of the right to using someone’s likeness; it’s a crime.

**Nagisa?**: ………

**NEGI**: “Could it be Shaka-san?

You’re Shaka-san, aren’t you? You can’t fool my eyes, who do you think did the procedure on you?”

**Nagisa?**: Ahahahahahaha.(1)

Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.(1)

**NEGI**: “……!?”

**Shaka**: That’s amazing. You might have just tricked me into revealing the truth, but I didn’t think you would find me out this quickly.

I should not have just practiced on-stage performances, but I should have practiced genuine acting on top of that.

No, but still, did you all realize my true identity?

I envy you, brother. I see I see, because you’re holding in your arms something so precious and brilliant, it’s only natural that money and reputation could not bring out your interest.

**Ibara**: Where’d you take His Excellency to?

What “I”(2) will do to you depends on your answer—

**Shaka**: Rest assured. Right now, he’s in the safest place in the world.

However, nobody would think of the him in there as Ran Nagisa.

**NEGI**: “……Did you steal his existence?

And then you took over? Was that your purpose, Shaka-san?”

**Shaka**: Indeed, my friend. (3) I have captured and confined Ran Nagisa and remodeled myself using Priest’s technique.

And then we exchanged forms with one another, and in this way replaced each other.

I have obtained that child’s life.

As a reward for that, I bestowed my life upon that child.

Isn’t it a good deal? With this, he can become the world’s number one idol without any hardships—

**Ibara**: Even if you didn’t bestow it upon him.

His Excellency is, we are, planning to reach “there” with our own strength sooner or later.

**Shaka**: Ahaha. You said the same thing he said. You have such a close relationship. It’s heartwarming.

You guys are pretty cute. I enjoy your cherubic mannerism and reactions. 

**Jun**: GODDAMN! Ibara, it’s okay to rough up this guy, yeah~? Just this once, me and Ohii-san will pretend we didn’t see anything!

**Hiyori**: —It’s no good.

**Jun**: Huh? Wh-why is that, Ohii-san?

**Shaka**: That child over there is prudent.

Let’s imagine it. Indeed, I am a criminal. For example, yes, let’s say I’ve cheated and robbed a bank out of a large amount of money

At this rate, I might get arrested by the police. So that I could escape safely, I should take hostages.

**Jun**: Gotcha, so in this situation, Nagi-senpai is the one being held hostage……!?

**Hiyori**: Yes. Until we can safeguard Nagisa-kun without incident, there is no way we can erase this guy who is the only one who knows where that child is.

So Ibara, I know you’re probably irritated, but please refrain from going on a rampage.

**Ibara**: Yes, I would not have done so even if you didn’t tell me that, Your Highness.

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/ycv4o19o.png">

(Location: Absolute Stage)

**Ibara**: This goes back to the boring analogy from earlier. When bank robbers take hostages and escape, they typically make certain demands of the police.

And your demands are? An escape vehicle? The release of a fellow prisoner?

**Shaka**: I don’t have any associates.

Yes, even Nagisa Ran, who’s the same type of living being, was the same way.

Being at the top is lonely. I’m always, always exposed to the freezing wind up there.

I’m at my limit. And that’s why, I’ll be leaving this place.

The rest is for you to decide. The world’s number one idol? If you want that worthless title, then why don’t you go for it?

I’ll throw away all that trash and take my life into my own hands.

By any means necessary.

**Hiyori**: …… You didn’t answer Ibara’s question. What do you want from us?

What can we do to get Nagisa-kun back?

**Shaka**: I am Nagisa Ran now, though. If you want the child formerly called “Nagisa Ran” back, you don’t have to do anything.

No, just appear in Absolute as planned.

Let’s perform together. As Eden, as a group of four close friends like usual.

**Hiyori**: How disgusting…… If I hadn’t built up my resistance thanks to Eichi-kun, I would’ve been pissed.

**Shaka**: At the same time, Nagisa Ran will stand on stage as Shaka. And I’m sure this Absolute will end with Shaka winning like that.

The outcome was already decided before the event even began. And just like that, Shaka will continue to be the world’s number one idol.

Unfortunately, “we” failed to put up a good fight and lost, so we returned to “our” home country with “our” heads hanging low. “We” comforted each other, and are on good terms with each other.

Afterwards, I will become someone no one knows again and live a second life.

I’d like to grow flowers or something. I like it. Fufu.

**Ibara**: Even though they’re flowers, they seem more like carnivorous plants. Or rather, caterpillar fungus? (1)

**Shaka**: That right, that’s how I will sprout, using that poor child as a seedbed.

I will blossom in full glory. Just like your national flower, the cherry blossom.

**NEGI**: “Why……?

For us, Priest was an enemy to us both. That was the one thing that connected us, we were friends.”

**Shaka**: ………

**NEGI**: “We were supposed to be. Why are you doing the same thing that horrible man did?

There’s nothing in this world that should be done at the cost of someone else’s life.

I’m borrowing someone else’s— my younger brother’s body in order to exist, so you’re probably thinking ‘this ghost is one to talk.’

But, I pity you, Shaka-san.”

**Shaka**: …… You can say whatever you’d like. You’ve been a great help, NEGI-chan.

Thanks to you, I can fantasize about leading a different life. I had no choice but to throw away that Shaka who I absolutely hated, and replace him with someone else—

Thanks to you, I was able to make such a miracle a reality.

If you do extraordinary good deeds like that, you’ll surely go to Heaven. To the eternal paradise our God has built.

I’m almost certainly going to Hell.

But, nevertheless, I’m happy.

**NEGI**: “There’s nothing else I can say…… Nothing else can come from me.

I can’t think of any more words or songs to say to you.”

**Shaka**: It hurts my heart to make a good child feel sad. But in reality, I have nothing else to say to you all anymore.

Priest has disappeared, and his subordinates have actually lost control and are in a state of panic.

I have pierced through the cracks in their hearts, and embraced them as pawns wrapped around my finger.

**Ibara**: …… A small mystery has been solved. If the subordinates of Priest who seemed to have been protecting Shaka-shi all this time have already become your pawns, then you can easily disappear without a trace.

You were in a heavily guarded place called the “fortress.”

However. For you, the place you were in wasn’t a closed cell. You already had the key to get out.

**Shaka**: That’s exactly right. I greeted my pawns who were keeping an eye on me and confidently left the “fortress” through the main gate.

After that, it was easy. I can change humans’ appearances. So I simply replaced Gatekeeper’s hotel employee with a subordinate of my own and allowed them to infiltrate.

My pawn, while disguised as an employee, secretly handed Nagisa Ran a note in advance, calling for a meeting in the middle of the night.

Then they called for Nagisa, drugged him, sedated him, and abducted him.

**Ibara**: I see. So, it wasn’t because I was careless that His Excellency was abducted while I was sleeping peacefully.

Still, carelessness is carelessness. If only I had kept a closer eye on His Excellency to prevent him from coming into contact with anyone like that—

**Shaka**: If you had kept a close eye on him, bound him up, and deprived him of his freedom, then he might have become sick like me someday.

There’s no such thing as a 100% “correct” answer in this world, boy. The only outcomes are victory and defeat, success and failure, based on the rule of survival of the fittest.

And now, I’ve won. I triumphed over you, and I’ve triumphed over life.

**Ibara**: ………

**Shaka**: Just a reminder, don’t go getting any strange ideas.

If I give the word to my pawns, Nagisa Ran, who’s now in the form of Shaka, will immediately ascend to Heaven. That pathetic hostage is still in the hands of the bank robbers.

If his life matters, then you should listen to me.

Let’s see through to the end of Absolute as planned. After that ritual, he and I will have completely traded places, and I shall depart for a new world.

Whole New World…… Ah, how wonderful that sounds!

(A few minutes later. A secret discussion with everyone else, a slight distance away from Shaka who is taking on Nagisa’s appearance. )

**Hiyori**: …… He said everything he wanted to say to his heart’s content, huh.

What should we do, Ibara? Is there really nothing that can be done?

**Ibara**: No. I’ve said this over and over again; but Shaka-shi is still only that world’s number one idol, and is not a pro criminal.

Even though that plan looks perfect, there are still flaws here and there. Shaka-shi probably persuaded Priest’s subordinates and made them his pawns by saying something like the following.

“This time as well I, Shaka, will make money, so just shut up and obey me.”

That Shaka mentioned is of course His Excellency Nagisa who was forced into Shaka-shi’s position and appearance.

**Jun**: Meaning……?

**Ibara**: Meaning, Priests’s subordinates would not be so easily able to dispose of Shaka-shi = His Excellency (1), who would be the said money tree.

Even though Shaka-shi was threatening us with that smug face (2), I can conclude that the likelihood of harm being inflicted on His Excellency is quite low.

But still, that’s not absolute. Because it’s possible that Priest’s subordinates might choose that option.

Where the fake Shaka-shi, which is His Excellency, gets disposed of, and afterwards, the real Shaka-san gets captured and returned to his original appearance— And have him be the world’s number one idol this time as well.

**NEGI**: “That would probably be the worst plotline for Shaka-san. Because the thread of hope that he grasped with great pains has to be cut short right there.

…… Shaka-san said that he couldn’t help but hate, hate himself.

That’s why he’s throwing it away. It made him despair that much.

I didn’t notice it.

When he was talking to me, Shaka-san was a naive, kind older brother, so much so that it felt like the title of the world’s number one idol didn’t suit him.

But. That was all a lie. He simply wanted to steal useful techniques from me……

When he said that his life was being targeted so he wanted help, the truth was that it wasn’t like he was being targeted by a killer.

It was, simply, an excuse to learn those techniques from me?

No. Was the person targeting Shaka-san’s life— Shaka-san himself, who couldn’t help but hate, hate himself?

The other person Shaka-san was afraid of was Shaka-san himself, who would crush himself into nothing. That person was worn out, split himself apart and became crazy.”

**Ibara**: ……However, that’s exactly why we should not let our guard down.

Shaka-shi is a bomb with its fuse lit. If you carelessly provoke him, he’ll blow up instantly.

So that His Excellency may return alive and return to everyday life as usual— we have to overturn that plan with nothing less than carefully and conscientiously .

**Jun**: But, what should we do? Do we have no choice but to appear in Absolute as planned, just like Shaka-san told us to?

Ah, we just have to spill everything to the audience gathered here! Expose Shaka-san’s plan, and just like that—

**Ibara**: I guess the venue will be filled with outbursts of laughter.

Who’s going to believe in us? No, between us who have no recognition here, and Shaka-shi, which of us is more persuasive?

Even if we claim that “Ouw fwiend has been wepwaced with the wowld’s numbew one idol ~!”(3) in clumsy English.

It will just be taken as a joke or some strange performance.

Absolute is the festival of insanity; the Fanatic Festival.

In this crazy environment, no matter how seriously you try to convey the truth, it’ll only be taken as a comedy routine.

It’s naturally ridiculous to think that a human would be replaced.

**Jun**: No way…… But, I see. That’s what’ll happen.

**Hiyori**: Maybe. That’s probably why Shaka-san brazenly showed himself in front of us and politely explained everything.

Even if we were to spread the truth around, no one would believe it—is what he means.

**Ibara**: That self-conceit is deadly. It’d be great if I could say that, but I can’t think of what to do at this moment.

Shaka-shi and his pawns Priest’s subordinates seem to be cooperating, but their goals are different—

That part feels like the main point that will allow us to break their plans.

I still can’t think of a way to do that. Still a move too short. (4)

**Jun**: ……?

**Ibara**: ? What is it, Jun? Did you think of something?

As expected of the man who unpredictably manages to pull off a miracle once in a blue moon! 

**Jun**: Oh, um, don’t you hear some kinda weird sound?

**NEGI**: “Ah, it’s the smartphone! From Hiyori-sama’s pocket!”

**Hiyori**: Ah, Aah…… Come to mention it, it doesn’t really matter now that we’ve come to this, but I was thinking of having Ibara analyze the smartphone.

Because it seemed like Shaka-san sent detailed correspondence to the Staff in Absolute’s Tent Village.

**Jun**: Thinking about it now, that’s probably because Shaka-san had planned to have Nagi-Senpai appear on Absolute as his substitute.

**Hiyori**: Mm. So that Priest’s subordinates would listen to what he said, and at the same time, to not have them get involved any further—

It’s necessary for Shaka-san to win Absolute overall.

They should have made arrangements for that. Have Nagisa-kun perform as Shaka-san’s substitute, no, as his living sacrifice(5) — and make him win.

And then he offers to Priest’s subordinates the money tree to replace himself.

By way of such a ritual, Shaka-san would finally be completely free. He would foist everything he hated onto Nagisa-kun, and he would set out on a journey to a new world.

…… It’s a revolting story though. Well, that’s why we thought there would be correspondence from Shaka-san again, so that’s why we borrowed this smartphone.

We thought that if we could trace the call through this smartphone, we would be able to pin down Shaka-san’s whereabouts.

**Ibara**: You mean to say that you’ve received a call on that smartphone? So that means, it couldn’t be— please lend it to me!

**Hiyori**: Wawaa? I get it, I’ll lend it to you, so don’t be so rough?

**Ibara**: The number is restricted…….but could it be?

—Hello? Could this be Your Excellency?

<br>

TL NOTES:
<ol>
<li>Shaka-shi = His Excellency; in this part, Ibara literally uses the equal sign =, which probably means that he’s treating Shaka and His Excellency as a singular subject in this sentence, but also considering this is supposed to be spoken language; how did he do that? Mod kept it in for your enjoyment.</li>
<li>Ibara used slang here; ドヤ顔 (DoyaKao) which literally means ‘face you’ll beat’, but used the same way as ‘smug face’.</li>
<li>He actually said “Our friend has been replaced with the world’s number one idol~!” in normal JP, but added a cutesy, babylike でしゅ(Deshu) instead of a normal です (Desu) at the end. So. As a side note, he used 僕たち (Bokutachi) here. It’s a polite first person plural pronoun that he never uses otherwise.</li>
<li> He’s speaking in board game (chess, go, shogi, etc) lingo. He said he lacks 一手 (itte) or literally, ‘one move’.</li>
<li>The word 生贄 (Ikenie) is sacrifice as in, ritual sacrifice.</li>
</ol>

(Location: Absolute Stage)

(An hour later. The world’s biggest idol festival, Absolute, is now commencing.)

**Gatekeeper**: ………

**Ibara**: It seems like this Absolute is going to be very turbulent, Uncle.

Nonetheless, as the saying goes, “those who enjoy gambling enjoy losing.”

No matter what happens, the system is set up so that you, the owners, will turn a profit. Sooo, I’m not worried about the business aspect of things.

**Gatekeeper**: …… Little Ibara. Yer alive?

Fuun. You’re still a cheeky brat that flirts with life and death.(1)

In that way, you’re not similar to that Boss at all.

**Ibara**: “You’re alive?” That’s my line. NEGI-shi was worried about you, Uncle Gatekeeper.

Actually, it’s a shame that you’re alive. I was just thinking of getting my hands on your sizable inheritance after you died, Uncle.

**Gatekeeper**: Haa, it’s not like I’ll get killed by this disorderly rabble that’s lost Priest, its head.

Inversely, since Priest disappeared after SS, there was a period of time where I also let my guard down.

Of course, I lectured those assholes who attacked me telling them “Don’t fuck with Uncle,” and disciplined them by dropping my fists on their heads.

**Ibara**: And in reality, you must have done something a hundred times worse than that, huh…… As always, I feel sorry for your enemies.

**Gatekeeper**: Kukuku. That’s why yer shouldn’t try to pull anything stupid against me, Little Ibara.

The clean freaks of the world have the wrong idea about things.

You can’t erase dirt like me. Because the world is filthy down to it’s very core, no, the world itself is a massive pile of dirt.

To erase all the dirt would mean erasing everything in this world.

The people who want to make the world a more pristine place are the ones with a screw loose in their head.

**Ibara**: I’d like to somewhat argue against that sentiment. Well, as you can tell from my costume, I don’t have the time for unnecessary discussions at the moment—

Let’s just get straight to the point and ask you what you want to hear.

Although, I’m sure it’s not necessary to ask. The fact that you’re alive and talking so haughtily—

**Gatekeeper**: Oh. Come to think of it, you brats were also going to perform in Absolute. I was so uninterested that I forgot.

I’m going to say something yer not going to like. When you wear a stage costume like that, you look even more like that Boss when he was younger.

**Ibara**: I suppose all young children’s faces look the same to you, Grandpa.

Additionally. Appearance-wise, I’m sure he looked more like His Excellency than I do?

**Gatekeeper**: Don’t lose yer temper. If yer do that, I can’t help but think yer cute …… And?

**Ibara**: A moment ago, I conducted business with Shaka-shi.

Essentially, I plan to settle this matter by accepting all of his terms and agreements.

**Gatekeeper**: Fuun, what did that Shaka guy say? Well, I assume I already have a pretty good guess as to what it is?

**Ibara**: He wanted freedom.

In this land of the free, America, he was simply a slave stripped of his freedom more than anyone else. (2)

And we, Eden, are here to release him from those circumstances.

**Gatekeeper**: Kukuku. That asshole Shaka is also foolish. He can’t do anything other than singing or dancing; he’s just an amateur who easily gets exploited in the business world.

And yet, he’s trying to set up a match in “our ring” called business.(3)

**Ibara**: Please don’t lump “us” together. You and I are different.

“I”’m different from you, who snuggled up close to the person you loved more than anyone else and swore your loyalty to him, but couldn’t even reach his heart in the end.(4)

**Gatekeeper**: ………

**Ibara**: At first, it was a contract. I was merely the employer, and His Excellency was just a useful tool.

However. Now, that cold and dry relationship is starting to change slightly. Truly, only a little.

The emotions that filled my heart when I heard Shaka-shi’s arguments earlier was probably not merely anger at having my property stolen.

Yes, I would like to think that’s the case.

**Gatekeeper**: So that’s how it is. As much as possible, let us be yer example of what not to do so yer can achieve your own success.

I’ve said it many times before, but I have high hopes for yer, Little Ibara. If that’s the case, then yer, all of yer, could maybe reach a different future from the Boss and I.

…… God, what a foolish sentiment.

Go on, now. There’s still things you have to do here.

**Ibara**: Yes. The long-awaited performance by Shaka-shi, the previous winner of Absolute, is about to begin.

This Absolute has been a bit lacking in cohesion and excitement since Priest, who held a great influence over the competition, has died.

If the previous champion, not to mention a huge star who’s won six times in a row, appears, that relaxed atmosphere will be blown right away.

Or rather, everyone might get too excited and an outburst would occur, so please do your best to keep things under control, Uncle.

**Gatekeeper**: That’s what I came here to say. Yer really should summarize more briefly, yer always so roundabout.

Well, it doesn’t matter. That’s fair, and Uncle Gatekeeper will give you a late New Year’s gift.

**Ibara**: Thank you very much, Uncle.

**Gatekeeper**: I don’t need any thanks. It’s not even worth one sen.(5)

For the flow of the story, I’ll act like an uncle and say this. It’s fine if yer an idiot, as long as yer all alive and well— that’s the best thanks yer can give me.

**Ibara**: I see. My, my, that’s nice and very cheap♪

<br>

TL Notes:
<ol>
<li>The phrase originally used for “flirting with life and death” is “不貞不貞” (futeifutei) which is just the word for being an adulterer written twice. Futei is also a homophone for “不逞” which means insubordination so there’s potentially a pun here as well.</li>
<li>Mod hated writing this line as much as you probably hated reading it. Yes he really used to word “slave” (“奴隷” dorei) here.</li>
<li>He specifically uses the word for a sumo wrestling ring here! “土俵” (dohyou)</li>
<li>Ibara’s using his very rare personal pronoun 俺 (Ore), which is a rude, typically masculine personal pronoun. He usually uses 自分 (Jibun) which is an impersonal, somewhat militaristic way of referring to oneself.</li>
<li>One sen is one-hundredth of a yen. For reference, as of May 14th, 2024, that’s worth 0.0000064 of a US dollar. The sen became invalid as currency in 1953 due to inflation, along with other coins worth less than one yen (like the rin).</li>

(Location: Absolute Stage)

**Shaka**: Fufu. You’re putting on a gloomy face, Nagisa.

Nagisa?: ………

**Shaka**: An idol, a performer atop the stage, should always be smiling. Isn’t it basically the same even if the country is different?

My previous self, Shaka, was not the type to be that sociable, though. Because even if I didn’t try to sell myself with flattery like that, Priest would have granted me the victory, you know.

Smiling or not smiling, the devotees(1) would still diligently offer flowers to their idol(2).

Nevertheless. If you put on that gloomy face that looks like you’ve gone ill, even the audience who are so enthusiastic they stop being able to see anything anymore might be able to guess that something strange is happening.

So smile, Nagisa.

Smile even if you don’t feel like smiling.

I’ve always done that too.

Well, that’s fine. I’m in a good mood right now, to the extent that I don’t feel like everything needs to be how I want it to be.

All of you have complied with the deal, thus in this way gave Nagisa Ran’s everything to me.

A second life; of freedom.

I’ll be satisfied with just that.

Aah, for the first time since I was born, I’m content.

Nagisa?: ……I see.

But it’s a deception. If that’s the case, I would not particularly say it’s a good thing.

**Shaka**: ? You are—

Nagisa?: I’m glad that you’re free, Shaka-san.

As a friend, “I” wonder if “I” managed to grant even one of your wishes. (3)

**Shaka**: You, are, NEGI-chan……? What is……?

Nagisa?: Fuu…… Ah, I couldn’t keep quiet and ended up talking. My mistake, my mistake, as expected, if I talk, I’ll get found out so I zipped my mouth closed.

**Shaka**: So you really are a transformed NEGI-chan? How do you know Nagisa Ran’s form?

**NEGI**: “Yep. Since I got found out, I’ll go back to this form. Ahaha, somehow I’m more like a yokai than a ghost.

Aah\~ it was suffocating. If anything, I was supposed to be a silent character, but sometime down the road, I ended up liking to talk.”

**Shaka**: I did feel like a certain air about you was weird, but—

**NEGI**: “I mean, I transformed in a hurry so it wasn’t very complete. There’s a possibility that someone like you, who has the same techniques, will be able to see through it.

But, it’s fine enough. Because the stage’s curtains have opened—

Nobody could stop it anymore.”

**Shaka**: ………

**NEGI**: “But I’m really glad. You’ve always been everyone’s idealised image, the symbol of hopes and dreams.

Even if you didn’t wish for it, there are many people who were saved by your songs.

It really is nice if there is salvation for you, who is like this, too. If you were able to smile even just a little bit.

Could that become the proof of my empathy and friendship to you?”

**Shaka**: What do you mean? Have you betrayed me? This is a breach of contract!

As a result of the deal, Nagisa Ran and I swapped places. From now on, Nagisa is supposed to be the one who will live as me— as the world’s number one idol, Shaka.

And then I’m going to be Nagisa Ran, finish Absolute with an air of innocence, return to my home country(4) and start my second life—

**NEGI**: “I’m sorry. I didn’t betray you, but I did lie.

But don’t worry. Your wish will surely come true. It probably won’t perfectly be in the form of how you wanted it to be though.

You will, you too, can be free.

Just like me.

That Priest is dead, Shaka-san. So we don’t have to be tied down anymore.”

**Shaka**: ………

**NEGI**: “Fufu. You’re perplexed. It must be the same for the audience of this Absolute.

Shaka-san’s stage, where people would sing and dance with the world’s number one idol is supposed to start—

The ones who will appear are the foreign idols that still nobody in this country knows about♪”

**Nagisa**: “♪\~♪\~♪\~”

**Hiyori**: “\~………♪”

**Shaka**: Nagisa, Ran. And, that child, his partner.

**Hiyori**: My name is Hiyori Tomoe. I’m not Nagisa-kun’s extra, you know?

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu. Yes, I had you.

…… That’s why I didn’t break down like Shaka-san, I was able to protect my warmth and self ego.

…… You were the one who bestowed them upon me, Hiyori-kun.

**Hiyori**: No. From the beginning, I simply nurtured (5) what you were already gifted with.

I diligently watered you with a watering can every single day.

**Nagisa**: …… Thanks to you, I was able to come into bloom.

…… I’ll always and forever be grateful, Hiyori-kun.

**Hiyori**: No need for thanks. You’re family, Nagisa-kun.

**Nagisa**: …… I thought you would be more angry. Because I caused you trouble and made you worry.

**Hiyori**: Of course I was worried, but this time around, you didn’t do anything wrong did you, Nagisa-kun.

It’s all the fault of that idiotic dumbfounded criminal over there.

Hey, move away. This is our stage.

Even on a stage as strange as Absolute, if there are two people with the same face, onlookers would be confused.

(Location: Absolute Stage)

**Shaka**: What—W-What is the meaning of this?

**Ibara**: “\~……♪”

The plot is simple. Today, the world’s number one idol, Shaka-shi, shall mysteriously disappear.

**Shaka**: I- are you planning to kill me here……?

**Ibara**: Why? There’s no need to do that, since destroying evidence is troublesome.

Of course, you still have to put in the effort in order to succeed.

If you’re going to keep taking unnecessary actions, you’ll wind up overworking yourself without any benefits.

**Shaka**: ………

If I— if Shaka disappears, there’ll be a big uproar, won’t there?

**Ibara**: Is that what you think? Actually, there was an uproar this time, and we were all swung around quite a bit, weren’t we?

Please rest assured, no one is that interested in others.

**Shaka**: ………

**Ibara**: No, you are in the spotlight since you’re a huge star who’s won Absolute six times in a row.

If a replacement star were to shine in the night sky, you will eventually be forgotten as a person of the past.

**Shaka**: You all, will become “that”?

**Ibara**: How does that sound? We’ll work hard to achieve that goal, but we may not be able to reach it yet.

But. Even if it isn’t us, someone will always win. Someone will conquer this Absolute and become a new shining star.

You will become a legendary deity as the world’s number one idol who mysteriously disappeared, all while remaining undefeated—

The idols you worship are now a separate existence from you.

You should leave everything to those idols and fictional deities, and live freely as an unknown person.

**Shaka**: Th-That sort of thing—

That kind of thing, is fine? So, I can live the life I want?

**Ibara**: That’s right. It truly is simple. Later on, the Priest faction will also use Uncle Gatekeeper as a shield to threaten, no, negotiate—

Today, let’s take the steps to make the new shining star, the winner of Absolute, their next “money tree.”

And with that, the story ends with everyone smiling and feeling very satisfied.

**Shaka**: ………

**Ibara**: In fact, it would have been better if you had asked this talented producer to fix the problem from the beginning.

Because you did unnecessary actions, there was a strange uproar.

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/ikdeni6z.png">

**Ibara**: If we had met as planned from the beginning and you asked us honestly then and there, we could have easily resolved this matter without making it such a big deal.

If you had done that, I would have had to pay the price for it, but I would have done my job properly.

No. That’s what a fair and legitimate deal is, amateur-san♪

**Shaka**: ………

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu. Ibara has a cute smug look on his face for the first time in a while.

**Hiyori**: Cute, huuh? Looking at it makes me feel annoyed, though? What foul weather!

**Nagisa**: …… For the longest time, Hiyori-kun and I haven’t shared those kinds of tastes.

…… Hiyori-kun prefers obedient children like Jun, right?

**Jun**: “\~……♪”

Haha. You usually get mad when I don’t listen to you, ri~ght, Ohiisan?

**Hiyori**: Rather, I don’t understand how it feels to be happy when I’m being snapped at, you know?

**Shaka**: ………

**Jun**: Hey. Ohiisan told you to “move away”, you’re not needed so you should probably get outta here, alright?

Go anywhere, wherever you like?

**Ibara**: Oya, is it really fine to let him go? That person is a criminal who kidnapped our own His Excellency.

Our subordinates are stationed at the wings of the stage, so if we wish to secure him at any time, we can do so, can’t we?

**Hiyori**: It would be a bother if he got away with it and became resentful. I don’t want to have to worry about him like this again.

**Shaka**: ………

**Hiyori**: Look, we said we would forgive you, so why don’t you run off somewhere before we change our minds?

**Shaka**: B-But…… Even though Priest has died, there’s no way his subordinates would overlook me.

**Hiyori**: You poor thing. I suppose you’ve been brainwashed into thinking that way based on years of experience. Like an abused child.

**Ibara**: This is just a fact. The forces on the Priest side have thrown their hands into the fire called Uncle Gatekeeper and have been mostly annihilated.

I just checked with Uncle about that.

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu. This time, did Ibara use Monban(1)— Gatekeeper for that purpose?

…… For that reason, you stuck close to him, holding the reins and controlling him from beginning to end?

**Ibara**: It would have been cool to say something like “That’s right.” However, as expected, I’m not that well prepared either.

**Hiyori**: Ibara was so worried about Nagisa-kun that he couldn’t stay calm♪

**Ibara**: You’re saying that as the person who was the least calm.

In any case, the surviving members of the Priest faction are also paying attention to the Absolute stage.

This event is their lifeline in this region. In order to keep living, they have no choice but to stay here and watch over it.

In other words, there may not be any oversight now, so it will be as lenient as possible.

My subordinates will give them instructions so they can quickly follow them and defect abroad.

**Shaka**: ………

**Ibara**: That’s all. Your crime, no, all the strange things that have happened here will be settled.

What happens after that is *our* story, and has nothing to do with you.

Here, please take your things and leave.

I’m satisfied with the fine transaction this time.

It was a pleasure doing business with you, *former* world’s number one idol♪

**Shaka**: ………

(Location: Absolute Stage)

**Nagisa**: …… Shaka-san.

…… Your misfortune was the fact that you were the world’s number one idol.

…… That is, everyone had the wrong assumption that your existence is like that of a distant God, and not a single person had tried to comprehend your feelings.

…… Except for your friend NEGI-chan, the only one who sympathized with you.

**NEGI**: “Ahaha. But in the end, I wasn’t able to do anything.

That’s very frustrating, though.

I can’t really be like Anzu, huh.”

**Hiyori**: You’ve done your best, more than enough.

You were great. You exerted yourself and didn’t give up, for your friend’s sake.

That’s something past-me would not have been able to do even if I wanted to.

But, because you didn’t give up and acted while carrying along your warm feelings, you were able to move us too—  and we were able to reach such a gentle conclusion.

Anzu-chan must be proud of you too.

**NEGI**: “Ahaha…… I’m a dead person who shouldn’t even have any body temperature, so I’m a cold person, and I think the warm feelings you’re talking about is probably from my brother.

So. My brother, Hitsugi, is living inside of me.

If that’s true, then I’d be happy.”

**Nagisa**: …… Every step was in preparation(1) that leads to here.

…… Ibara behaved like he was accepting the deal with Shaka-san so that it would give you a sense of relief.

…… During that time, everyone ran all around and found me.

**Hiyori**: We didn’t run around that much. Even on your end, you didn’t give up and looked for an opportunity to secretly make a call—

Because with all the investigation we’ve done at that point, we were closing in on Nagisa-kun’s whereabouts.

After that, we just needed to extend our hands out a little more.

Fufu. The hand that past-me was not able to extend, now, is finally able to reach you.

**Nagisa**: …… You have never once let go of my hand, Hiyori-kun.

…… Always, whenever it is, I  feel the warmth of your hand linked with mine.

**Hiyori**: Uuuuu, Jun-ku\~n! 

**Jun**: Wh- can you please not come over to hug me just because you were moved\~!? I’m not a sandbag you can use to punch your feelings at or something you know!

**Ibara**: Fufu. Putting aside that comedy sketch(2), I’ll take over the explanations from His Excellency.

After we safeguarded His Excellency, His Excellency who took up Shaka-shi’s appearance because of Shaka-shi — was returned to his original appearance using NEGI-shi’s technique.

And just like that, all of Eden now stand assembled on the stage.

Shaka-shi. As long as you kept His Excellency at arm’s length and were on high alert, I wouldn’t have known if you would accidentally go off and hurt him.

You were in a peculiar state, so much so that one can figure it out just by talking to you for a bit.

You’ve become like someone harboring a knife. I couldn’t meddle when His Excellency was in close proximity to a weirdo.

**Nagisa**: …… That’s why it can only be this moment.

…… Shaka-san. It could only be during the moment you were to make Nagisa Ran of Eden, whom you have chosen as your second life, to appear in Absolute .

…… You were anxious and scared and would not let go of my hand.

**Jun**: It really feels like a bank hostage and barricade situation huh~ Pretending to comply with negotiations to avoid provoking the criminal to secure the hostage. 

Just like that, if we get to get the hostage back, it’s ours for the taking.

**Shaka**: …… In this situation right now, do you not think that I’ll blow up? Is not restraining me fine with you?

**Nagisa**: …… We won’t do something like that to you, Shaka-san.

…… You should not be foolish enough to throw away the freedom that you would even commit a sin to get by causing an uproar yourself.

…… No. I believe that is the case.

…… Because I do admire and am envious of you, for me, who wanted to become you for even a moment, I understand your feelings.

…… In the past, I didn’t even know how impaired I was. I was a childish, ignorant child.

…… However. Right now I know just how valuable “that” thing that you’ve always wanted is.

…… Hiyori-kun had, everyone had taught me that.

…… I’m proud of this knowledge, no, of this growth I’ve gained.

…… That sort of person I was; is affirmed, and loved.

…… When I say I love myself, it means that it’s an affirmation of the love of those who love me.

…… I could only pity you, who till the very end, does not know love.

…… Before, I was envious of you. But it wasn’t necessary.

…… I already have so much of the thing you’ve always desired.

…… I suppose I would even be able to obtain your position as the world’s number one idol sooner or later.

…… If it’s with my family and friends; alongside everyone in this “Eden”.

“\~……♪

Fufu. We’ve kept the audience waiting for quite some time. I feel sorry to be bringing along the bad Japanese idol industry tradition of talking endlessly while on the stage even overseas.

For the people of this country, this must seem quite strange—

Because I suppose nobody knows who we are, we will start with introductions anew.”

# Epilogue

## 1

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/afv5nmo8.png">

(Location: CosPro Conference Area)

(Time passes and it’s now one week after Absolute. ES Building, CosPro offices.)

**Jun**: Good mo\~rnin’♪

**Ibara**: ………

**Jun**: Huh, is something wrong, Ibara?

You’ve been sighing with a gloomy face since early this morning, but if you do that, all your happiness will leak out, right~? Didn’t your parents ever tell you that?

**Ibara**: Such superstitions are unscientific, and you’re making me far angrier than necessary by trying to one up me by mentioning my parents.

**Jun**: I wasn’t trying to one up you…… Ahh, so you’re reading past newspaper articles and reflecting on them by yourself?

**Hiyori**: Ahaha. In the end, we didn’t produce any results with Absolute.

**Nagisa**: …… Sorry. I think it’s mostly my fault.

**Ibara**: It is. I don’t know if you got overly excited or what, but it’s a problem that you proudly said “I am God” in a place with a high Christian population.

Unlike this country that’s ruled by countless gods, if you say something like that over there, you’ll be treated like a deviant.

Being a chuunibyou isn’t an excuse, got it? Understood?

**Nagisa**: …… But it’s something you created, Ibara.

**Ibara**: Of course, the fact that His Excellency grew up to be such an idiot is my own responsibility as an educator. No, it’s fundamentally also His Highness’ fault, since he’s the one who shaped His Excellency’s mind in the first place.

**Hiyori**: Eh\~? I’d rather he grow up to be a good child!

**Jun**: Anyways, it wasn’t Nagi-senpai’s fault that we weren’t really popular at Absolute.

**Ibara**: Yes. After all, the spirit of a foreign country’s Absolute is different from that of Japan.

Of course, we had a perfect performance, but it was just “perfection in Japan.”

A big circus of those eccentrics and strange people opened up on the Absolute stage—

At that “Fanatic Festival,” we were far too ordinary.

Because Shaka-shi kept us busy doing various things, we weren’t prepared enough for the Absolute stage— well, it can’t be helped.

The world’s biggest idol festival wasn’t so easy that we could conquer it with an unprepared, basic Eden.

**Hiyori**: The timing of going up on stage was also troublesome. But it was the best thing to do in that situation.

At that moment, everyone in the audience was expecting the world’s number one idol, Shaka-san, to take the stage.

But, instead, the ones who took the stage were some unknown foreigners.

It can’t be helped that the atmosphere became like, ‘Go back, we didn’t ask for you.’

**Ibara**: Yes. We couldn’t have predicted in advance that we’d have trouble with His Excellency being kidnapped, so, like I’ve said many times before, it couldn’t be helped—

If this continues, it’ll affect Eden’s reputation. We are the strongest idols in Japan, we’re at the peak and an object of admiration.

We can’t end on a losing streak. Fortunately, Absolute is held three times a year, so next time, let’s prepare properly and try again.

And this time, let’s grasp the crown of the world’s number one idol with our own hands and make a triumphant return.

**Jun**: To do this, the first step is training, the second is lessons, and even if there’s no third or fourth, the fifth step is hard work\~♪

**Ibara**: You’re a person who loves training way too much…… Well, what you’re saying is correct, regardless.

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. Jun is always right.

…… You’re a pillar of Eden for saying and doing ordinary things in ordinary ways.

…… Because we often become detached from the real world.

**Hiyori**: Especially Nagisa-kun. You’re not truly a god, so I hope you don’t go floating away into the sky.

…… Hm?

**Ibara**: If it isn’t Anzu-san. How rare for you to come by CosPro.

Now then, are you here to make fun of me as a fellow producer for not being able to produce results after making such a big deal out of it?

**Jun**: Anzu-san probably isn’t that mean spirited. It’s not like she’s a certain someone we know?

## 2

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/dro3wn5p.png">

(Location: CosPro Conference Area)

**Jun**: So? Is there something you need at our office~ Anzu-san?

Um? Um……. Eh, uh? Wonder if it’s okay if I say this~?

**Ibara**: Jun’s reaction itself is the answer. Learn about yourself a little bit more, and learn how to carry yourself.

**Hiyori**: Fufu. It seems like good-for-nothing Jun can’t say it, so I, as his master (1), will say it in his place.

Anzu-chan probably came to our office because she thought that Ibara, as a well-informed person, would know something.

**Ibara**: I’m not a convenient informant, rather I’m your rival in the same profession though?

**Hiyori**: Fufu. While in America, we certainly did properly meet NEGI-chan, who was supposed to have died.

”Anzu, Anzu” she kept talking happily about you.

You really are precious friends, aren’t you? Like Nagisa-kun is for me.

**Jun**: You always think of me like I’m the pet dog while Nagi-senpai is a friend, but the difference in the way we’re treated is too cruel…

**Nagisa**: …… Really? On the contrary, sometimes I feel envious of Jun though?

**Ibara**: Your owner(2) would be right here though!

**Nagisa**: …… No, I’m talking about how I’m envious of Jun’s position where he sometimes gets told cruel things because it feels like you have an amicable relationship.

…… But Hiyori-kun cherishes me. It seems I’m being taken cared of, but sometimes it’s a little lonely.

**Hiyori**: Fufu. Loving people is difficult, no matter what you do, discontent will happen.

Setting that aside, why does Anzu-chan know about that?

Hmm. You saw someone curious somewhere in town?

Someone you didn’t know, but resembled NEGI-chan? So you were wondering if they were a transformed NEGI-chan……huh?

You say, because you thought it was so, you got happy and talked to them, but they ran away so you’re wondering if you’re being hated by NEGI-chan…….

No. That’s probably a misunderstanding. Because NEGI-chan cherises you very much, you see.

After all, especially around Absolute, she has to hide her face since she’s been moving around too much. Recently, she’s been exercising self restraint and secluding herself because of some strange rumours.

Naturally, since there is a high degree of risk of NEGI-chan being doxxed in this country she used to live in, it seems that for the time being, she plans to be overseas where information would be difficult to reach her.

**Nagisa**: …… Yep. So the person Anzu-san saw was probably not NEGI-san.

…… That was probably Shaka-san.

…… Hm? Who is Shaka-san you ask? Oh right, Anzu-san doesn’t know him do you?

…… By now, he should be living as a different person.

…… Even though I helped him flee the country, I don’t know what he’s doing right now.

…… Once, there was a person who was called the world’s number one idol.

…… That person was just like a God. 

…… He became a real God, and even now, he is worshiped by his devotees.(3)

…… However. Those devotees(3) don’t know about the truth that is not even written in the sacred scriptures.

…… He’s cast off the shell of God, leaving it behind to become a free human being.

…… Similar to what my father once did.

…… Perhaps one day, I will walk the same path as they did.

…… Reaching the zenith, and becoming tired of everything.

…… But, that is not now.

…… As you can see, right now, I’m very content.

\~………♪

## Nagisa Ran - A Cold Day's Rendezvous

### Episode 1

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/1ga5vhb1.png">

**Nagisa**: …… We’ll stop here today. When should we have the next meeting?

…… If you tell me the days you’re available, I’ll tell Ibara to open up my schedule for it.

…… I don’t mind if we change the place to meet next time. Is there a place you’d recommend?

> Option 1: I know a good cafe.

**Nagisa**: …… In that case, let’s have the meeting there next time. 

…… Maybe it’ll be good to have the meeting over tea after a meal.

> Option 2: What about COCHI……

**Nagisa**: …… There certainly is a space for meetings there. 

…… It looks like we can have a meal together too, so let’s hold the meeting in COCHI next time.

> Option 3: In CosPro still.

**Nagisa**: …… Because it’s easy to take our time here? 

…… You’re right, it’s comfortable here in this lounge area and it’s nice. It looks like the staff’s been earnestly looking after it.

### Episode 2

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/8t3lawku.png">

**Nagisa**: …… Well then, let’s start the meeting. We’re continuing from last time……

…… You just received a message? 

…… Could it be an urgent correspondence? It seems serious, you should handle it first. 

> Option 1: I’m sorry……!

**Nagisa**: …… I always heard that Anzu-san is busy.

…… I still have time, so I don’t mind postponing this for later. 

> Option 2: I’ll finish it immediately.

**Nagisa**: …… Mm. While waiting, I’ll organise the contents of the meeting. 

…… I hope that by doing that, I’ll be able to shoulder some of your burden, Anzu-san.

> Option 3: It looks like it’ll take a long time……

**Nagisa**: …… It’s okay, there’s still some extra time. 

…… If there’s something that I can handle first, please let me know. 

### Episode 3

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/elb794eu.png">

**Nagisa**: …… We’ll stop here today. When should we have the next meeting?

…… If you tell me the days you’re available, I’ll tell Ibara to open up my schedule for it.

## Nagisa Ran - A Premonition of Success

### Episode 1

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/39tato4g.png">

**Nagisa**: …… Anzu-san, look. There’s a crowd of people at that shop, I wonder if they’re holding an event. 

…… Heeh, a lottery event? I can use the lottery ticket that they gave me while I was shopping? 

…… Since we’re here, why don’t we draw the lottery? I hope there’s something nice. 

> Option 1: Let’s make sure we win it!

**Nagisa**: …… You’re full of energy. I’m sure luck will respond to your enthusiasm. 

…… Fufu, my heart is pounding too  ♪ 

> Option 2: I wonder if we’ll win……?

**Nagisa**: …… I wonder. I don’t know either, but I do have confidence. 

…… There’s no basis for it, though. I just have the feeling like I’ll win it. 

> Option 3: It looks like you can’t lose.

**Nagisa**: …… That’s right. You can get pocket tissues.

…… Fufu. Since we’re here, I want to win something big ♪ 

### Episode 2

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/7unxsj86.png">

**Nagisa**: …… It’s almost our turn. 

…… From what I can see, it looks like nobody got the first place prize yet. It’s a “Pair Overseas Travel Ticket’. Quite luxurious.

…… There are a lot of other expensive-looking prizes too. Is there something you want, Anzu-san?

> Option 1: Of course the first place prize.

**Nagisa**: …… I see. Traveling abroad, huh……

…… It looks like it’ll be fun to travel in a pair with someone. I might be starting to want the first prize to.

> Option 2: The coupon for a sweets buffet.

**Nagisa**: …… Aah, it’s the one that’s being hosted at a famous hotel, isn’t it? 

…… I think Ibara will scold me for it, but if we win it, let’s go together. 

> Option 3: Household appliances look good too.

**Nagisa**: …… Fuun, they’re household appliances I’ve never seen before. I wonder if they’re the latest ones, they look interesting.

…… Anzu-san, do you know much about that sort of thing? If you don’t mind, I’d like you to tell me some things. 

### Episode 3

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/uvqelykx.png">

**Nagisa**: …… That’s unfortunate. Both of us got participation prizes.

…… Well we didn’t win, but we had a fun time. 

…… But sure enough, I still have some regrets. Maybe it’s a good idea to make some sort of plan in place of the prizes we didn’t win. 

> Option 1: Boldly go traveling abroad.

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu. If Anzu-san really has the opportunity to go abroad, I’d be happy if you’d tell me stories from your travels. 

…… I want to try listening to a lot of stories. Like how you feel when you’re in a place far away from Japan? 

> Option 2: Go have a slightly expensive meal.

**Nagisa**: …… Fuun, maybe it’ll be good to go out for a meal with everyone once in a while. 

…… Anzu-san is always working hard. I think it’ll be nice as a reward. 

> Option 3: Go buy the newest home appliances.

**Nagisa**: …… I see, that’s a lovely idea. If you’d like, would you let me accompany you? 

…… Because I don’t really know much about home appliances, I’d like to hear Anzu-san’s recommendations.

## Ibara Saegusa - Singing Advice

### Episode 1

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/nemw4ah1.png">

**Ibara**: …… Fuu. Apologies for keeping you waiting, Anzu-san.

You said there was something you had to do, but what exactly is it?

If you were in a rush, you wouldn’t have waited for the lesson to end.

> Option 1: I was going to deliver this……

**Ibara**: This…… is my towel, isn’t it. Was it in the hallway?

You could have just left it there, but thank you for going out of your way.

> Option 2: Don’t worry about it.

**Ibara**: It’s outrageous that you’re being so considerate. You’re a busy person, so I can’t afford to bother you with such trivial matters!

Next time, please contact me and I’ll come to you wherever you are……☆

> Option 3: I had some time to spare.

**Ibara**: Hmm, well it’s time for a break now. So, you came to deliver something I forgot……

Well, I should really be grateful for this. Thank you for your consideration!

### Episode 2

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/93qso936.png">

**Ibara**: Anyway, you were paying very close attention to my lesson, so I wonder, is there anything you’re curious about?

Honestly, I’m not sure I can say I’m unsettled or what…… Well, it won’t be resolved if you just watch, right?

…… You’re planning to go to karaoke, so you’d like to use this as a reference?

> Option 1: Do you have any tips for getting better?

**Ibara**: In regard to basic ways to improve your singing skills, I’m sure you already know about them, correct?

All that’s left is to be confident in yourself and to sing without any reservations. With that alone…… the other person will surely think you’re doing well.

> Option 2: Sorry to disturb you.

**Ibara**: No, no, it’s not as though you’re getting in the way! It’s important to do reconnaissance on the enemy!

In fact, I’m all the more excited!

> Option 3: There’s no one else I can listen to……

**Ibara**: Haah, I’m sure there are people around you who’d be willing to teach you to your heart’s content, right?

Well, since we’re in the vocal room, let’s take a look at where your skills are at.

### Episode 3

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/3fg9wciq.png">

**Ibara**: I don’t think it’s necessary to be able to sing well at karaoke. Anzu-san is not an idol, but rather a producer.

I don’t mean it in a bad way, it’s just that the people around you probably don’t have high expectations.

Wouldn’t it be better to think about livening up the room rather than singing well, so you won’t have to be so nervous?

> Option 1: I see……

**Ibara**: There’s many ways to liven us an event, it’s not just limited to your own singing skills, but it also includes your song selection.

If you think of it as planning an exciting live performance, you can probably come up with a wide variety of ideas, right?

> Option 2: Is it really okay to be bad at it?

**Ibara**: It’s not like you’re competing in scoring mode, so I don’t think you’ll have to worry about that.

…… Or rather, is there really any need to be so worried?

> Option 3: Livening things up, huh……

**Ibara**: Using props like tamborines, maracas, and so on.

Well, I’m not an expert on this, either. Why don’t you ask someone like Akehoshi-san about that?

## Ibara Saegusa - A Very Busy Night

### Episode 1

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/z9gcs7v3.png">

**Ibara**: (Next is to reply to that email, check SNS while waiting for a reply, and……

Ah jeez, it’s just one thing after another. There’s no end in sight to this work……

There’s a limit to black labor(1), right? I’m at the end of my rope here.)

> Option 1: Umm~……

**Ibara**: Yes yes, I’ll hold onto the documents…… Isn’t that what Anzu-san said?

What are you doing at this hour? It’s almost closing time here.

> Option 2: Thank you for your hard work.

**Ibara**: Ah, it’s Anzu-san. Thank you for your hard work.

…… Am I feeling unwell? Ahaha, why would that be the case?

> Option 3: A-Are you okay?

**Ibara**: Yes. I’m not unskilled at multitasking…… But you look like you’re tired, aren’t you?

You don’t have to look so worried.

### Episode 2

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/7rreq3cw.png">

**Ibara**: Apparently the office is being cleaned tonight…… So I decided to rent this space.

The store will be closing in a few minutes, so no one will bother me after that.

I was consulting with 2wink a while ago, and before I knew it, that time had come.

> Option 1: By the way……

**Ibara**: Eh, Jun was looking for me?

What does he want? Well, if it’s urgent, he’ll probably call me.

> Option 2: Hmm……

**Ibara**: Oh? Are you curious about 2wink?

They are now a promising prospect for CosPro! We’re hoping that they will act as our golden geese!

> Option 3: They’re relying on you, huh.

**Ibara**: …… What’s with that face? Are you dissatisfied with something?

Those kids probably have a few things they don’t want to tell you, right? Well, it wasn’t anything all that important.

### Episode 3

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/ofh7l04s.png">

**Ibara**: Well then, I have to get serious now……

Anzu-san, don’t you think it’s time for you to go home?

Chocolat Fes finally ended. It’s important to rest when you can.

> Option 1: That goes for you too.

**Ibara**: Ahaha☆ This is something that happens everyday!

When the enemy has their guard lowered, someone attacks them from behind…… There may be people like that lurking.

> Option 2: Maybe so.

**Ibara**: Fufu, advice from idols can be useful sometimes.

That’s it. I have some energy drinks in the fridge, so you can have one.

> Option 3: Don’t push yourself too hard.

**Ibara**: Yes yes. I’m planning to go overseas the day after tomorrow, so I just need to get my work done before then.

Fortunately, I can get some rest on the plane.

## Hiyori Tomoe - Adorable Sweets

### Episode 1

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/4hqzy07f.png">

**Hiyori**: Ah, my plans are ruined! What foul weather!

Oh, it feels like someone’s eyes are on me…… Anzu-chan, don’t be shy and come on over.

Do I look upset? I want to deny it, but your prediction is correct.

> Option 1: In that case……

**Hiyori**: Are you going to invite Jun-kun? Unfortunately, he’s busy working on a solo job right now.

He’s not by my side at such a critical moment!

> Option 2: I’ll make some tea.

**Hiyori**: I’m not particularly thirsty though…… Or perhaps, are you trying to comfort me?

Fuun. If Anzu-chan is willing to make some for me, then I’d be glad to drink it♪

> Option 3: Let’s take a deep breath.

**Hiyori**: I don’t think you can be positive just by taking a deep breath, though?

Well, since Anzu-chan suggested it, I guess I’ll give it a go.

### Episode 2

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/m4d9aop4.png">

**Hiyori**: Will you hear me out? I found some adorable sweets, so I left them in my room with the intention of taking them to the Pretty5 meeting……

But then Rinne-senpai ate them!

When I went to buy the sweets again, they were sold out and I was so disappointed!

> Option 1: What kind of sweets are they?

**Hiyori**: Could it be, Anzu-chan will look for them?

Certainly, you can’t find them on your own! Now then, feel free to ask!

> Option 2: That’s a shame.

**Hiyori**: So, I’ll leave it to you to find out if other stores sell it!

It must have been fate that we met here♪ You’ll help me, right?

> Option 3: Let’s find a substitute.

**Hiyori**: I wanted to show everyone those sweets. I don’t know about any substitute sweets……

Eh? There’s sweets that are perfect for me? You’ve caught my attention, so I’d like to hear more about it!

### Episode 3

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/on1ifzp4.png">

**Hiyori**: Thanks to Anzu-chan, there’s hope!

Hmm, now that that’s resolved, you’re feeling a bit peckish, aren’t you?

As thanks, I’ll treat Anzu-chan to something she likes! I’ll follow your lead!

> Option 1: The employee cafeteria is good.

**Hiyori**: Even if I said we were going to have a meal, you shouldn’t settle for the employee cafeteria!

I don’t dislike the food there, but today I’m going to take you to a restaurant that I recommend!

> Option 2: Cafe Cinnamon is good.

**Hiyori**: Rinne-senpai is pretty involved in Cafe Cinnamon though, isn’t he?

Rinne-senpai is surprisingly concerned about all this. It’d be bad to make him worry, so I’ll refrain from going there today.

> Option 3: There’s a newly opened cafe……

**Hiyori**: Does the cafe that opened near ES have quiche plates?

That’s good informaiton! I hope you can show me the way to that store soon!

## Hiyori Tomoe - When Going Abroad

### Episode 1

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/t8o8s0xz.png">

**Hiyori**: Today’s Anzu-chan looks ill, am I right?

You definitely work too much. If that happens, I’ll take you away on a long vacation!

Maybe we’ll go to an overseas resort♪ It’s necessary to get away from everyday life!

> Option 1: Just because it feels good……

**Hiyori**: Ugh come on. You seriously have the nerve to refuse my good wishes?

I want to take you by force, but…… That’s too harsh for a working person like you so I’ll cut it out.

> Option 2: Now is a bit……

**Hiyori**: Who cares about right now, you’re busy every day aren’t you? You’re just like Ibara.

There’s no point in forcing you, so I’ll hold back. If you change your mind, you can always tell me♪

> Option 3: It looks like there’s going to be a break……

**Hiyori**: Your big work will be done for a little bit, right?

That’s fine, but…… You should be aware of your own limits.

### Episode 2

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/6ddqd55q.png">

**Hiyori**: You’ve been so busy that you haven’t been able to go out much lately……

It might be a good time to breathe in the air of other countries, not just resorts.

Just imagine it. Anzu-chan, is there anything you’d like to try overseas?

> Option 1: I want to see art.

**Hiyori**: Oya, that’s an unexpected answer, isn’t it?

I have a catalogue that I bought at an overseas museum, so if you don’t mind, I’ll show it to you next time. It’s important to cultivate an eye for aesthetics!

> Option 2: Local food……

**Hiyori**: There’s a lot of delicious food that can only be eaten locally.

The next time I go somewhere, I’ll buy you a souvenir♪

> Option 3: I want to go shopping.

**Hiyori**: Yes yes♪ There’s a lot of interesting things overseas, it’s exciting!

If we have a chance to go abroad together, I’ll go shopping with you!

### Episode 3

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/66dmp52x.png">

**Hiyori**: I feel like I haven’t been getting much rest lately either……

Since it’s all the same to you, I’m going to invite Nagisa-kun to visit a nearby place now.

You’ll also come with, right, Anzu-chan?

> Option 1: Today is a little……

**Hiyori**: Are you working late at ES today? I guess it can’t be helped.

But please return at a reasonable time! That’s your promise to me!

> Option 2: Maybe next time……

**Hiyori**: Do you want me to just tell you the story? Hmm, why don’t you just come along?

Well, it’s fine. Please let me know if you change your mind.

> Option 3: Please have fun.

**Hiyori**: Huh, if you have something to do then it can’t be helped, right?

I’ll send you a pic later. If you share my happy mood, then you’ll do better at work♪

## Jun Sazanami - A Day of Bootlicking

### Episode 1

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/gvke6w0j.png">

**Jun**: Thank you for telling me about a good store. So there’s a popular western confectionary shop over here, huh. 

As Anzu-san knows, Ohii-san is so particular about what he puts in his mouth, it’s annoying.

His regular shop was closed today, so I didn’t know what to do. You being here is a real help~♪

> Option 1: I wonder if he’ll like it.

**Jun**: Yeah. Maybe he’ll have complaints here and there, though……

But if we tell him it’s a shop you recommended, maybe he won’t be reacting so badly?

> Option 2: The truth is…….

**Jun**: Ah, it’s a shop that Himemiya-kun told you about?

In that case, it feels even more reliable. If you’re a rich person, you probably have a proper palate, right?

> Option 3: What happened to Senpai?

**Jun**: He’s holed up in his room right now~

His mood was ruined by a minor thing…… And that’s why I’m here being made to lick his boot.

### Episode 2

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/zjwg7lbr.png">

**Jun**: Now. After this, I have to do a few shopping that Ohiisan asked me to do……

He’s making me mad. But I guess while I was reading the manga I borrowed from Isara-san, I ended up ignoring Ohiisan’s call.

I got scolded and my manga got taken away~ He said he won’t return it till I finished with all the errands, but I borrowed it so it’s a problem for me, you know~?

> Option 1: Sounds tough.

**Jun**: Haha, you’re pretty much the only one who understands my hardships.

I got used to Ohiisan’s mood swings, so it’s not that tough, ya know~

> Option 2: Maybe he was lonely.

**Jun**: Ahaha, if that’s the case, there’s still something cute about that.

For now, until Ohiisan’s mood settles down, I can’t do anything but endure it.

> Option 3: What kind of manga?

**Jun**: It’s a foreign manga~ See, when I try to read American comics, it’s surprisingly interesting?

A new series is coming out soon or something, so I’m in the middle of considering buying that one myself .

### Episode 3

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/9btulfp3.png">

**Jun**: When I said I was running errands for Ohiisan, Nagi-senpai asked me to do some shopping, so I went to the bookstore.

When I bought the book he asked me to get, I was given a book band, maybe cause they were holding a campaign~

I don’t think Nagi-senpai will use something with this fancy pattern. So wanna use it instead?

> Option 1: Just as I was wanting one.

**Jun**: Alright, if it’s the paperback size, it looks like it’ll fit just right.

Haha, you don’t need to thank me. I got it for nothing, so don’t worry about it, see~?

> Option 2: This pattern is……

**Jun**: Eeh? You think Nagi-senpai would be happy with it? With this cat pattern?

The cat’s colours are just like the colours of our eyes? Heeh, coincidences like that happen too huh~

> Option 3: Is it really okay?

**Jun**: Yes. Nagi-senpai’s book had a book cover with no pattern on it♪

Use it without thinking about it too much, okay~

## Jun Sazanami - The Way to Resolve Loneliness

### Episode 1

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/bvobwijl.png">

**Jun**: Look, Mary. We still have time, so you can play as much as you like~

Anzu-san, thank you for coming along with me to play with Mary.

Haha, maybe she got lonely because we went overseas, and now she’s clinging to either me or Ohiisan.

> Option 1: She seems really delighted.

**Jun**: That’s right, she’s wagging her tail so much it looks like it’ll fall off…… Cute thing ♪

Dogs can’t get out according to the timing they want, so the moment they get to go out, they’re even more delighted, huh~

> Option 2: She was lonely when you were apart, huh.

**Jun**: It must be. I was lonely too……

Ohiisan looked even lonelier. The energy when they were both reunited again overwhelmed me you know~

> Option 3: Because I’m having fun too.

**Jun**: That’s good then. I met you by chance and now I’ve dragged you into this……

Ah, Mary wants you to pet her. Here, please pet her……♪

### Episode 2

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/3ooux2kp.png">

**Jun**: To apologise to Mary for making her feel lonely, with his spirits, Ohiisan brought her with him to a pet shop.

He bought a large quantity of pet toys. He didn’t even think about where to put all of it, you know~?

My and Sakura-kun’s room isn’t a warehouse though. Well, if there’s a toy you wanna try, just tell me, okay?

> Option 1: Maybe I should use the ball.

**Jun**: Here. Mary should be happy to fetch it if you throw if for her.♪

Uh, if you throw it with that much energy, she won’t be able to keep up with you you know~? Adjust it just a little bit okay?

> Option 2: Maybe I should use a chew toy.

**Jun**: This thing that’s shaped like a bone? It looks like it’s fun to chew on and she’ll get absorbed with it.

Ah, if it’s Mary I think it’ll be fine, but please be careful to not get your own hand chewed okay?

> Option 3: Maybe I should use a rope.

**Jun**: Ahaha, maybe it’s because it’s a tug-of-war kinda play, but Mary seems to like it.

The other time, she played tug-of-war with Ibara. Seeing both of them being weirdly serious was very funny.

### Episode 3

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Absolute/xwccb2k9.png">

**Jun**: Playing to your heart’s content with animals like this is fun too, huh.

Maybe it’ll be good to go to the dog park to play with Ohiisan next time?

When that time comes, if Anzu-san’s free, you can come too. It’s more fun to play when there’s more people♪

> Option 1: Let me join, okay.

**Jun**: You’re just like Ibara, always busy…….

It’s not a bad idea to go out and move your body once in a while.

> Option 2: The others…….

**Jun**: Together with Akehoshi-san’s and Oogami-san’s kids?

True. Since we’re going, we want to bring along people who have dogs too.

> Option 3: It’s being used for a shoot……

**Jun**: Heeh, the dog park you went to the other day seemed good?

Can you tell me the location later? It’ll be helpful if you could send it to my smartphone~
