# Chapter 1

**Adder**: ………

**Vanis**: Adder.

I’m here. Why didn’t you want to play at the casino?

**Adder**: I’m not interested.

Besides, it isn’t a place meant for me to enjoy as the owner. It’s a place to entertain guests.

**Vanis**: Well, that’s true.

(Internally) But……

(Internally) Adder seems to like this sort of play.

**Manager**: Adder-sama…… would it be all right if I consulted with you for a moment……?

**Adder**: What is it?

**Manager**: Actually, a troublesome devil has been frequenting the casino recently……

He’s a troublesome person who’s been making a killing by arranging high value bouts for various customers.

**Vanis**: A casino disrupter? If I’m not mistaken, I’ve heard that some casinos have gone bankrupt.

**Adder**: …… And?

**Manager**: A-About that…… I’m truly sorry but I would be grateful if Adder-sama could do something about it……

**Adder**: Do something about it yourselves. You probably hire demons for that purpose, right?

**Manager**: That’s right, but……

**Vanis**: Ah, those devils lost too?

**Manager**: I’m deeply ashamed to say so……

**Adder**: Incompetent staff aren’t needed at my casino. Fire him now.

**Manager**: U-Understood……!

**Vanis**: And? Can’t you do something about the disrupter?

**Adder**: Just hiring a replacement devil should work.

**Vanis**: This place might go bankrupt before they get hired, though, don’t you think?

**Adder**: ………

**Vanis**: If the casino goes bankrupt, then Rosé might have a rough time. Adder, your favorite chef might be lost.

**Adder**: ……? The story went by so quickly, I don’t understand what you were trying to say.

**Vanis**: When Rosé showed his face in the kitchen the other day, the chef was apparently cutting onions.

Rosé hates onions, so he was angry at the chef in the same way as before. He was unreasonable.

**Adder**: …… And?

**Vanis**: But lately, Rosé has been having so much fun at the cabaret that he hasn’t been paying attention to the chef.

**Adder**: ………

**Vanis**: I suppose the cabaret is more important than bullying the chef. But if this place were to go bankrupt…… he might start thinking of bullying the chef again.

Wouldn’t it be good to keep the place open until the chef’s new full course that you were looking forward to is ready?

**Adder**: …… Seriously, every last one of you are troublesome.

**Vanis**: Where are you going?

**Adder**: Where the disrupter is. I want to see the skill strong enough to take down a casino.

**Vanis**: (Internally) I suppose that’s true, but it seems he wants to protect the casino and divert Rosé’s attention from bullying the chef.

(Internally) It looks like Adder was looking forward to the chef’s new work than I thought.

It seems interesting, so I’ll go check it out too.

# Chapter 2

**Adder**: —Raise, add two cards.

**Casino Disrupter**: Gh…… …… Call.

**Adder**: Open, straight flush.

**Casino Disrupter**: This can’t be……! Why do you always have the stronger hand……!!

**Adder**: Luck is something you attract to yourself, isn’t it? You don’t even have the guts to do that, so you’re stuck with a two pair.

**Audience**: Amazing…… Adder-sama won again.

I thought that demon was strong too but Adder-sama was so overwhelming that I have nothing to say……

Indeed…… If we don’t do well here, we’ll wind up in the same situation……

**Vanis**: (Internally) This might be bad.

**Audience**: I don’t think I’ll make any money at this casino. Are you going to look for another place to have fun……?

**Manager**: Ah, Adder-sama! I’m truly grateful, but…… It might be time to bring things to a close……

**Adder**: That’s right, isn’t it. It’s boring when there’s no feeling of resistance.

**Casino Disrupter**: N-Not yet! We can still compete!

**Adder**: Oh? Will you bite in without knowing what you’re getting into?

Then…… 

I’ll crush you completely.

**Casino Disrupter and Audience**: ………!

**Vanis**: Good grief……

**Vanis**: Hey, casino disrupter-kun. Leave this bout to me.

**Casino Disrupter**: What……?

**Adder**: What are you trying to do?

**Vanis**: I will compete in his place. Let’s play together every now and then, Adder.

**Adder**: …… Alright. However, I won’t hold back.

**Vanis**: Of course.

(Vanis goes to the casino disrupter)

Hey, can I take this seat?

**Casino Disrupter**: B-But—

**Vanis**: Is it really okay for you to continue like this, to the point of even your soul being extorted? If that’s what you want, then I won’t stop you, but……

**Casino Disrupter**: I-I understand……

**Vanis**: If you understand, then it’d be best for you to never set foot in this casino again.

(Vanis walks back over to Adder)

**Vanis**: Now then, let’s begin shall we?

**Adder**: …… Heh.

**Vanis**: …… How many cards will you turn?

**Adder**: That’s right, I—

**Vanis**: That reminds me, do you know? Our chef says he has some very good wine.

**Adder**: What’s this all of a sudden?

**Vanis**: Additionally, there’s a rare caviar that’s rarely ever available. The combination of it with that wine is the best, isn’t it.

**Adder**: What do you mean to say?

**Vanis**: Specifically? I just thought that if the casino shut down and the chef left, then the wine and caviar would disappear along with it.

Will customers *want* to come to a “casino where you can’t win”?

**Adder**: ………

**Vanis**: And? How many of your cards do you turn?

**Adder**: …… One card.

**Vanis**: Got it. I turn three cards and raise.

**Adder**: …… Open.

**Vanis**: I have a full house, and Adder—

**Adder**: Three of a kind.

**Vanis**: It’s my win then.

**Audience**: A-Amazing! He beat *that* Adder-sama!

I can’t believe it……

**Vanis**: It’s nothing special really, it’s normal. It looks like I can comfortably win here.

**Audience**: Alright, I’ll compete too! I feel like I can win big now!

**Vanis**: Hehe. Everyone’s mood’s improved.

**Adder**: …… Seriously, these people are foolish.

**Vanis**: It’s good though, isn’t it? That they’re the kind of guys who can lose the coup but win the bout?

**Adder**: ………

**Vanis**: I’m looking forward to the chef’s new creations and caviar. Ah and, of course, the chef’s recommended wine as well.

**Adder**: …… Hmph.
