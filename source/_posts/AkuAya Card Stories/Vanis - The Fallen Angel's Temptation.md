# Chapter 1

**Rosé**: Hm? Is that…… Elder brother and Vanis?

What could those two be chit chatting about?

**Vanis**: Let’s talk about the Six Demon Houses for a moment.

**Rosé**: The Six Demon Houses? Ahhh, I’ll pass on that annoying chatter.

But I would l-o-v-e♡ to know why Vanis has been so chipper lately. His skin looks clearer too?

**Adder**: As of late, you haven’t been pestering me for mana.

**Vanis**: Well, things have been going well as of late, you know?

**Rosé**: Heeeh? Spill the tea♡

**Vanis**: I didn’t do all that much.

There’s a nobleman I’ve gained the favor of. I’ve been asking *him* for mana.

**Rosé**: Hm~? The kind of mana you eat is the super pure kind isn’t it, though? So there really are people out there who are kind enough to give away something expensive like that?

**Adder**: …… Don’t be a burden to others, Vanis.

**Vanis**: Adder is still so mean.

I’m just helping him out a little. Because for me, mana is vital.

**Rosé**: So basically he’s trying to pleeease his patrons? He does that kind of thing a lot.

**Adder**: That’s not something you can get from that sort of thing alone

**Vanis**: I didn’t do anything major. You just have to give the person what they want. 

Simply provide a conversation to those who want to converse, knowledge to those who want it, and profits to those who wish for it.

**Rosé**: Isn’t that annoying though? You should stop eating mana and eat souls instead♪

**Vanis**: It doesn’t work like that. You know I can’t eat human souls, don’t you?

All I need to do is be what the other person wants, so if anything I’m having fun doing it.

**Rosé**: You’re good at going with the flow— for better or worse.

**Adder**: Well, if that’s what it takes to secure your needs then it’s acceptable.

**Vanis**: That’s all it is.

**Servant**: Excuse me. I’ve come to deliver a letter for Vanis-sama.

**Vanis**: For me? From who?

# Chapter 2

**Vanis**: ………

**Rosé**: Do you have to go get your pet food from your patron right away?

**Vanis**: Ahh. …… It seems he’s died. He was involved in an unfortunate accident.

**Adder**: Could it be, your patron is from House Morgan?

**Vanis**: That’s correct, but…

**Adder**: In that case, that unfortunate accident must have been an assassination enacted by the Six Demon Houses

**Vanis**: …… Adder, surely you didn’t-

**Adder**: I’m telling you now that I had nothing to do with it.

But I suspect that’s not what House Morgan thinks. Since they were trailing behind all the Six Demon Houses except for Belladonna.

You should choose the people you surround yourself with wisely.

**Vanis**: …… Alright, I’ll deal with it properly.

**Rosé**: But, whaaaat next since your patron died before you could get your pet food? Should I give you a soul to snack on♪

**Vanis**: I appreciate the offer, but I want to refrain from becoming a demon.

And regardless, it hasn’t been decided yet that I won’t receive mana.

**Rosé**: Hmmmmm?

**Vanis**: I’ll be going out for a bit.

**Adder**: …… Do well.

**Vanis**: Fufu, of course.

(Time passes)

**Noble's Son**: …… Are you perhaps the fallen angel?

**Vanis**: Yes, I’m Vanis.

While he was alive, your honorable father treated me very well. He was kind enough to provide me with mana.

**Noble's Son**: I heard about it from him. He said you were well-learned, and that you were emotional support for him.

Um, Vanis-san. I have something I sincerely need to talk to you about.

**Vanis**: What is it?

**Noble's Son**: I’m saying this to you because my father was assassinated.

I’m worried that from here on my family and I will be targeted like my father was.

**Vanis**: I understand how you feel.

Because they’re hostile towards the Six Demon Houses you support, Belladonna is frightening, aren’t they?

**Noble's Son**: ………

**Vanis**: Shall I talk to Adder for you?

**Noble's Son**: ! Is that sort of thing possible?

**Vanis**: Personally, I don’t want to see my benefactor’s family fall into ruin.

In return—

You will have to swear allegiance to Adder, the head of House Belladonna.

# Chapter 3

**Noble's Son**: So that means…… From now on, I’ll be supporting House Belladonna?

**Vanis**: On the outside, you can still support the other houses as usual. As long as you pass some information along to House Belladonna.

**Noble's Son**: ………

If Belladonna can guarantee our safety, then we would really appreciate it.

However, I do wonder if I’ll be able to go between two opposing forces easily……

**Vanis**: It’s alright, I’ll support you. I wish you well with House Belladonna and the other houses.

Besides, if I’m pulling the strings behind the scenes then I’m also an accomplice. You’re not alone…… There’s nothing to be afraid of.

If you fall, I’ll fall with you.

**Noble's Son**: Th-That sort of thing! I’ll never let it get to that point! …… But……

I can’t believe you would take this house into such consideration. Truly, thank you, Vanis-san.

Ah, right. If there’s anything I can do for you, please let me know.

**Vanis**: Fufu, then I suppose I’ll ask you for one thing.

I would especially like a little bit of mana. And at the moment, I want yours.

**Noble's Son**: You want m-my mana? How do you intend to……

**Vanis**: Mana dwells within a pure heart. I know…… Imagine your deceased honorable father.

**Noble's Son**: Father?

**Vanis**: Yes. Just close your eyes.

It’s over.

**Noble's Son**: …… Thank you. Vanis-san— No, Vanis-sama.

While you were extracting the mana, I felt like I was able to meet my father.

**Vanis**: I’m sure your honorable father is also pleased that you made a wise decision.

(Internally) There’s nothing easier than manipulating the hearts of weak humans.

(Time passes)

I’m home, Adder.

**Adder**: How did it go?

**Vanis**: I’ve gotten a useful spy for House Belladonna.

**Adder**: And he won’t betray you, will he?

**Vanis**: As long as I’m in Belladonna, I’ll be alright.

It seems like he fully trusts me, and that he’ll even handle my mana.

Belladonna has even more reasons to let me stay here, don’t you think, Adder?

**Adder**: Hmph. I’ll tell you now, if you leave and someone betrays you, it’ll be fine to cut you off.

**Vanis**: You’re still as cold as ever, huuuh. You could’ve been a little happier about it.

Then, shall I  fawn even more over you, the beloved head of house?

**Adder**: You’d act like that with anyone.

**Vanis**: Maybe so.

**Vanis**: (In order to live in this absurd world……

For the sake of my “wish,” right?)
