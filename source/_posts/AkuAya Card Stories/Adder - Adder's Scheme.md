# Chapter 1

**Adder**: I was wondering why I was called for all of a sudden…… What do you want?

You’re wasting my precious time. Don’t talk about tedious things.

**Demon**: O-Of course. When I said talk, I meant talk of a money making scheme.

**Adder**: Oh?

**Demon**: For that reason— P-Please lend me money! I beg you! It’ll be profitable this time!

**Adder**: ………

Haaah…… I was wondering what you were going to say, but it turned out to be a tedious discussion afterall.

Do you understand the situation you’re currently in?

“It’ll definitely be profitable!” “I’ll pay you back tenfold!”

Up until this point you’ve been saying things like that and receiving investments from me, correct?

However, you’ve yet to repay me. First, repay that debt, and then you can continue to run your mouth.

**Demon**: If it’s about the money, I’ll definitely pay you back one day. This is a wonderful opportunity for that! If this money making scheme goes well—

**Adder**: Silence. I don’t feel like talking with such an incompetent man any further.

…… Ahh, now that I think about it.

For you, instead of something unclear such as that there will be more money to be made. Assuredly— you hear?

**Demon**: Wh-What are you talking about?

**Adder**: You…… Do you get along well with your parents?

**Demon**: …… Gh!

**Adder**: You’re said to be the complete opposite of a hopeless scumbag of a son, a kind-hearted, wealthy man who is admired by everyone, hm?

**Demon**: I-It can’t be……!

D-Don’t! This is just my problem. I can’t bother my family!

**Adder**: I see, I see. Such a shame. In that case—

**Demon**: Gah! Is this a…… Snake!?

**Adder**: It’s my pet. Cute, isn’t he?

(Internally) It’s just an illusion but…… it’s enough to intimidate him.

This guy has a favorite food, you know. It’s an incompetent demon’s— blood. 

**Demon**: P-Please forgive me! 

**Adder**: In that case, let’s make this money making scheme a success this time. That way, you can get rid of your incompetent reputation.

This is your last chance. I have high hopes for your work from here on out.

**Demon**: …… Gh, yes sir……!

# Chapter 2

**Adder**: ………

**Vanis**: Sorry for dropping by so late at night. Is now okay?

**Adder**: You….. If you think it’s bad then just knock.

**Vanis**: Did I interrupt your reading? You must be quite the studious person to be reading even before bed.

Were there any interesting books?

**Adder**: …… Hmph. Unfortunately, everything was disappointing.

This one too. It’s cliche with odd wording. This writer is no good.

**Vanis**: Even though you said that, it looked like you were reading it with full focus?

**Adder**: Did you deliberately come here to irritate me?

**Vanis**: No, it’s not that. There’s something I want to ask you.

**Adder**: And what is that?

**Vanis**: Alright, so it happened at a pub. 

It seemed like you had a dispute with a demon who owes you money. Furthermore, it looked like he would continue to do business with you in the future but……

**Adder**: Even though it just happened today, you already know it properly. That information you’re so proud of…… Did you use it?

**Vanis**: Well, that’s about it.

Although I still have my suspicions. I wonder, why did he still want to continue doing business?

If I were you, I would have known that everything that demon said was doomed to fail and that there was no way you’d make any money.

Under those circumstances, the debt will only grow. So why?

**Adder**: …… I commend your ability to quickly gather information, but you still have a long way to go. Your thoughts are superficial.

**Vanis**: Eh……?

**Adder**: I might use your connections to track him down in the future. I’ll let you know beforehand.

I have no expectations for that demon. What I’m looking forward to is his family.

His parents are wealthy people, they possess a large amount of money. Since you’re a socialite, of course you’d know them, right?

**Vanis**: Ahh. If I recall correctly, yes.

But, what about— Ah, so that’s what it is.

**Adder**: As long as he has parents, there’s nothing he can do. So, I’ll increase his debt as much as possible and drain it out of them.

Up until now, he hadn’t asked his parents for money because he didn’t want to be a bother, but now he can no longer say that. He has no choice.

I even threatened him as such. If he fails next time, he’ll have no choice but to take that final step.

**Vanis**: I see…… So that’s why you let him go.

**Adder**: Of course, just having the money available isn’t the end of it. With this incident setting the stage— I will use that family as my puppets.

**Vanis**: As expected, you’re well prepared.

**Adder**: That’s the end of the story. Now get out. I’m going to bed.

If you interrupt me any more…… You know what will happen, don’t you?

**Vanis**: Scary, scary. I was going to do it even if you didn’t tell me to.

…… Hm?

Even though he said he was going to sleep, he opened the book up again…… Looks like he was lying about the book being disappointing, huh.

Even I don’t really understand Adder’s thought process.
