# Chapter 1

**Marquis Nasturtium**: What did you just say!?

**Adder**: …… Did you not hear me? I said that a meeting for the sole purpose of reporting information was a waste of time.

If you can’t understand that, then why don’t you relinquish your seat to someone else? You senile old fool.

**Marquis Nasturtium**: Gh…… Hmph!

Then excuse me for today. Farewell, Your Excellency the Duke……!

(The Marquis leaves)

**Attendant**: Sir, p-please wait!

Adder-sama. Please excuse me.

(The attendant leaves)

**Adder**: ……

Hmph……

**Rosé**: El-der bro-ther♡

**Adder**: …… Rosé. I told you to knock before entering rooms.

**Rosé**: Well I just saw the old dolt going home♪

…… Hey, that’s the new spy we set up with Nasturtium isn’t he?

That young attendant. From the looks of it, he didn’t seem all that reliiiiable though?

**Adder**: Look at this.

This is the report left behind by that attendant.

**Rosé**: Heeh? From that meeting just now?

Even though that old dolt seemed to have a good eye. He passed it over nicely huu~h.

Come to think of it, that Nasturtium guy seems to be getting carried away. Even in the lounge the six demon houses go to has been filled with whispers that he’s strangely well off♡

They keep saying things like “The Six Demon Houses will become the seven demon houses.”

**Adder**: That’s why we’ve sent a spy there. He’s an exceptionally outstanding guy.

**Rosé**: Hee~h, outstanding?

**Adder**: He’s also talented. Even if something were to happen, he’d be able to handle it himself

**Rosé**: As expected from my elder brother♡ You really do trust your subordinates don’t you.

**Adder**: What?

**Rosé**: It’s a~lright♡ Because I understand.

Elder brother is honest, serious, and dee~ply passionate♡

**Adder**: Don’t say it in such a sickening way.

Belladonna is different from the other demon families that face a constant stream of betrayals and infighting. 

I’m simply doing what’s necessary to keep powerful demons in line.

(Time passes)

**Adder**: …… Enter.

**Vanis**: Can I have a moment?

**Adder**: What is it?

**Vanis**: I have both good news and bad news, which would you like to hear first?

# Chapter 2

**Adder**: Don’t put on airs, Vanis. Let’s talk quickly. I’m busy.

**Vanis**: So cold. Well, I’ll start with the good news then.

The spy sent to Marquis Nasturtium…… He contacted me via magic.

It looks like those guys are buying up magic tools and weapons.

So that they can attack Belladonna soon. 

**Adder**: Ha, and he didn’t even know that information was being leaked. What an idiotic man.

We’ll give him what he wants, and then turn the tables on him.

So, the bad news?

**Vanis**: Apparently, the spy was caught infiltrating Nasturtium.

**Adder**: ………

**Vanis**: Just as I was listening to the report, the magic ceased.

I heard a voice clamouring around right before it ended. By the looks of things, I wonder if he was found and imprisoned?

**Adder**: …… Is he currently being interrogated?

**Vanis**: I guess so. Rumor has it that the Marquis Nasturtium has an extreme preference for imprisoned people.

However, there doesn’t seem to be any concerns about information leaking. He said he would kill himself if a situation such as this ever arose.

It’s an admirable thing. It’s such a shame though, I really liked him too.

Adder, you feel the same too, don’t you?

**Adder**: He shouldn’t make decisions of his own accord. If he makes a mistake and dies while spying, then Belladonna doesn’t need him.

In the end, that’s all he was good for. 

If you’re a member of Belladonna, show that you’re willing to return even if half of your body is gone.

**Vanis**: I see. You’re so strict.

That’s the end of the report. Then, that’s it from me.

I know you’re busy, but please take some time to mourn for him, okay?

**Adder**: Don’t give me instructions.

**Vanis**: It’s simply a request.

# Chapter 3

**Vanis**: Adder.

**Adder**: What. Unlike a certain freeloader, I’m busy.

**Vanis**: Did you hear that the Marquis Nasturtium’s group are causing some trouble at the outskirts of the forest?

**Adder**: What, that matter……

It’s probably infighting. It’s a common story among up and coming demon families.

**Vanis**: I suppose you’re half correct and half incorrect.

…… It seems the person being chased by them is a traitorous attendant.

**Adder**: He’s alive?

**Vanis**: I have no idea. It looks like he’s fighting on his own in the forest.

Nasturtium seems to be expending a lot of effort to catch him alone. As expected of an outstanding subordinate.

**Adder**: …… He’s an idiotic guy.

**Vanis**: I just thought you should hear that. Sorry to interrupt you. See you.

**Adder**: Wait, Vanis. Gather everyone in the manor.

We’re going to clear out the Nasturtium guys in the forest.

**Vanis**: Eh? I don’t mind but…… Could it be, you’re doing it to save him?

**Adder**: He showed his determination to return to Belladonna. I’ll take advantage of his stubbornness and treat him leniently.

I intended to make Nasturtium pay for mocking me from the beginning. 

Vanis, you’re coming too. You’re the only one who can contact him with magic.

**Vanis**: What a relief, Spy-kun. It seems your obsession with life appeased the head of the family.

**Rosé**: I’m really allowed to go all out? Elder brother, don’t you go back on your words♡

**Adder**: Ah, I don’t mind if you’re rough with them.

**Rosé**: Let’s do it~♡

**Subordinate**: Adder-sama, all personnel have been assigned.

**Adder**: I’ll finish them off within the day. I’ll exterminate the entire clan.
