# Chapter 1

**Vanis**: What do you need? It’s unusual for you to call on me.

**Adder**: I’ve decided. About tomorrow’s kickoff party.

Tomorrow, all factions, humans, demons— and angels, will gather in Colchicum. I wanted to ask how you would be conducting yourself amidst it all.

**Vanis**: Me? Why now? I’ll just do what I always do.

**Adder**: As you always do…… huh. It seems you understand what you have to do as a freeloader.

Your redeeming quality is that affability of yours. Tomorrow, you’ll be networking. And if anyone catches your eye, you will inform me later.

**Vanis**: So you want me to screen people that could be used as pawns…… is that what you mean?

**Adder**: Well, that’s what I meant. I don’t intend on letting freeloaders eat for free. Do it well.

**Vanis**: Got it. Well, I was going to do that even if you didn’t tell me to, you know.

(Internally) Besides…… Tomorrow is a great opportunity to figure out what Gypsophila’s intentions are. In order to fulfill my purpose, I can’t miss this chance.

Is that all you wanted to talk about? I don’t think it’s worth calling me here just for that…… Unless, could it be that you were worried about me?

**Adder**: You guessed it.

**Vanis**: Isn’t it even more unlike you to be worried about me?

**Adder**: Worried…… It’s a bit different from that. It’d be more accurate to say I’m uneasy?

I think you also realize this, but naturally he will also be attending the kickoff party.

**Vanis**: He?

**Adder**: If you’re going to play dumb then I’ll say it clearly. It’s “Mere.”

**Vanis**: ………

**Adder**: Kukuku…… Your usual composed expression disappeared. As expected of you, though, to do so at the mention of Mere’s name.

**Vanis**: What are you getting at?

**Adder**: It doesn’t matter. Just don’t ruin my reputation tomorrow.

(Time passes, at the kickoff party)

**Human Man**: Hahaha! How interesting! To think that there’d be interesting people like you in the demon world!

**Vanis**: Thank you. I’m happy to hear you say that.

(Internally) Fuu…… Adder said all that to me yesterday, but I’m the same as usual. There’s nothing to be apprehensive about. At this rate, those expectations will……

**Human Noblewoman**: Kyaaa……!

**Vanis**: Oops.

Are you alright?

It’s good to have fun at parties, but don’t get too excited.

It would be terrible if a beautiful person such as yourself fell and got a scar on their face. You should be more aware of your own beauty.

**Human Noblewoman**: I-I’m sorry……

**Vanis**: No need to apologize. I should be saying sorry for saying something that would dampen your spirits.

As an apology…… Would you like to dance with me? Let’s enjoy this wonderful night even more together.

**Human Noblewoman**: B-By all means!

# Chapter 2

**Adder**: Why are you in a place like this? The party hasn’t ended yet.

**Vanis**: You…… No, I just needed a change of pace.

**Adder**: Changing pace is your way of doing things…… But, as a matter of course, what you need to do is also going favorably, correct?

**Vanis**: Of course. I’ve left no stone unturned. It seems your needless worrying from yesterday is over.

**Adder**: Needless? Don’t degrade me. Your pace is slower than usual, it’s obvious.

**Vanis**: What are you talking about? I’m the same as usual.

**Adder**: Don’t play dumb. After all, that Gypsophila lot are here, so it seems you’re more fatigued than usual.

**Vanis**: …… Good grief.

I thought I was hiding it well. You’re really observant, aren’t you.

**Adder**: Hmph. It must have been a burden for you since you’re just a freeloader. If you’re worn out, shouldn’t you scurry back to the demon world?

**Vanis**: Hahaha. Thank you for your concern. However, you’re caring too much. I won’t quit halfway through.

**Adder**: …… Hm, so that’s how it is.

That’s the correct answer. If you said you were going to quit here and now, I would’ve kicked you out of the manor.

We’re connected by our mutual interests. Don’t forget, if you become complacent, then you’ll no longer be of use to me.

**Vanis**: So you weren’t worried about me, you were testing me?

**Adder**: Who’s to say. At least, don’t betray my expectations.

(Adder leaves)

**Vanis**: Whew, Adder really is scary. He said he would kick me out, but that alone is inexcusable.

But…… I haven’t changed. Yes…… I just have to do what I must do.

(Time passes)

**Vanis**: Here, this is a list of humans who are connected with the devil. You can put this to good use, right?

**Adder**: Looks like you still have some value to you.

**Vanis**: It’s most important that you seem satisfied. So, does this mean I won’t be kicked out?

**Adder**: For now.

**Vanis**: That’s good, then. I also think it’s worth staying in Belladonna.

For the sake of doing what I must do…… Alright?
