**Writer**: Akira

**Season**: Autumn

(Location: Adam’s Private Room)

**Ibara**: Pardon me!

Saegusa Ibara, here to relay a message! I apologize for the intrusion!

However, I’d like you to hear what I have to say for 5, no, just one minute only!

I would never allow for the loss of your precious time! Salute~!

**Nagisa**: …… Ibara.

…… What’s wrong?

…… I’m not sure, but wait.

…… I’ll finish reading this book in a little while.

**Ibara**: Understood! I will wait!

Although, His Excellency’s “a little while” could mean anywhere from 3 days to a week, so standing at attention until then makes me have some concerns!

If that is your order, then this lowly servant Saegusa Ibara will wait even if it rains water or spears!

Servility! Devotion! Service! Ahaha♪

**Nagisa**: …… I don’t need a servant.

…… What I want is an equal I can love.

**Ibara**: Of course! If that is what you wish then I shall behave accordingly!

**Nagisa**: …… You’re a hard worker, Ibara.

…… Yes. Sorry, I just finished reading my book. I’ll listen to what you have to say now– what is it?

**Ibara**: Oh, amazing! Fine weather comes to those who wait……☆

**Nagisa**: …… Hiyori-kun? What about him?

**Ibara**: Ahaha♪ As expected of His Excellency! Ah, my stomach is tying itself in knots! I’m dying, I’m dying~!

**Nagisa**: …… When you exaggerate like that it feels like you’re mocking me.

**Ibara**: Apologies! This is a habit of mine! In this country where weapons are banned, non-violence and disobedience are among the greatest survival strategies!

Kill with praise and shatter with looks! The customer is God! Ahaha♪

**Nagisa**: …… Do you want to kill me?

**Ibara**: Of course not! His Excellency must live a long time! For the sake of a future by my own design, and for the future of the idol industry!

At any rate! My sincerest apologies for speaking nonsense when you graciously finished your book so quickly!

I shall state my business!

As per usual, I have finished arranging Your Excellency’s lesson schedule to align with Eden’s own!

Please confirm the contents for yourself~☆ (He hands over a booklet)

**Nagisa**: …… Ah. Helpful as always, Ibara.

**Ibara**: No no! It’s my pleasure to be of service to Your Excellency! Rather, I was born for that very purpose!

In any case, I will explain it briefly but, as usual, I have tailored the contents of the training according to Your Excellency’s current status as well as the schedule I’ve devised for Eden.

Arrangements are in place and are all set!

There is a slight deviation in muscle mass, so let’s work on rectifying the balance!

See, look at the line on this chart! Your shoulders need to be slimmed down to accentuate your stomach!

**Nagisa**: …… Ahh, so I did gain more muscle in my shoulders and back in the end.

…… The other day, I unearthed something interesting from the nearby ruins.

…… As the person who discovered it, I was allowed to examine that one item on my own.

…… I thought I should avoid breaking it, so I carried it myself and that’s when I gained muscle.

…… I grow quickly after all.

**Ibara**: Amazing, His Excellency is still in his growing phase!

However, I still don’t understand that hobby of yours.

That’s the item you excavated, isn’t it? That thing in the corner of the room that looks like a stone pillar with a letter engraved on it?

It appears to have cultural and historical value, but lacks artistic and financial value.

**Nagisa**: …… Archaeology is romance. You can’t assign value to dreams.

**Ibara**: We have a difference of opinion here then. Archaeology costs money and I’d rather build a bridge to the future than dig up the strata of the past with such resources!

Well, I’ll refrain from interfering with Your Excellency’s hobbies.

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. It’s work, and Ibara worked hard to assemble a schedule for me.

…… I will obey as much as possible, but I’d prefer to have more time allotted for my hobbies.

**Ibara**: “Obey” me, how amusing! I merely wish to aid His Excellency, the treasure of the entertainment industry, in reaching greater heights

Please don’t doubt my sincerity–my loyalty!

**Nagisa**: …… It’s fine. I don’t mind being used as you please.

**Ibara**: (Hmm. Dependent as always, he lacks the pride and dignity one tends to have with such talent.

Like a toddler he’ll obey me without much question.

However his work rate, output, and learning ability are far greater than the common person.

There are books piled up high in the corner that I don’t recall seeing when I checked on his this morning.

But he must have skimmed through them and memorized their content.

What takes the average person years to learn, he can do in a day.

And yet, he uses that ability to inspect artifacts of no value.

Ah, what a waste! I must use his qualities, his natural talent, much more beneficially!

That kind of gift must be given back to the world, it’s a disservice to ignore such a treasure trove!

Fortunately, this powerful “weapon” is within my grasp.

This Saegusa Ibara will utilize him to the fullest! With all my love and utmost caution……!)

**Nagisa**: ……. What’s wrong? You’re grinning– did something good happen?

**Ibara**: No no! I was just savoring the joy of having been so lucky as to have met His Excellency! Ah, I truly am blessed……☆

**Nagisa**: …… I see. Not many people would say such a thing, it makes me happy to hear that.

…… I hope we can continue to be friends from now on, Ibara.

…… Also, I don’t have enough documents here. Please procure the books listed on this memo.

…… While I wait for those to arrive, I shall train according to your wishes.

**Ibara**: Yes! Please do so!

For the sake of our bright future! Assault! Invade! Conquer! Ahaha♪
