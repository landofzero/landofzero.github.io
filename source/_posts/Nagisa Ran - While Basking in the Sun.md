(Location: Hanging Gardens)

**Nagisa**: …… It’s sunny today, isn’t it. When you talk about a climate suitable for basking in the sun, do you mean this type of weather?

…… It’s very warm under the sunlight, and the wind blows just the right amount, making it comfortable.

…… But I never thought that Anzu-san would also be basking in the sun.

> Option 1: Is that so?

**Nagisa**: …… When I see you, you usually look busy. I can’t really imagine you relaxing.

…… But even Anzu-san has times where she wants to take it easy. I hope this time gives you a good break.

> Option 2: I feel the same way.

**Nagisa**: ……? Ah, I guess it was a surprise to see me basking in the sun here.

…… It can only be done if you have time and the weather is just right. Since the conditions were perfect today, I decided to come to the hanging gardens.

> Option 3: It seemed to feel good, so……

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu, that’s right. When the weather is this nice, you can’t help but just want to bask in the sun.

…… But Anzu-san still has work to do after this. Be careful not to fall asleep.

(Location: Hanging Gardens)

**Nagisa**: …… Tenma-kun invited me to bask in the sun with him before.

…… At that time, he felt so good that he fell asleep halfway through.

…… It was supposed to be time for work, but he wouldn’t get up easily, so I started to get a little worried.

> Option 1: And after that……?

**Nagisa**: …… Don’t worry. When I said in his ear, “I have freshly baked bread,” he woke up right away.

…… It seemed like he was on time for work, so there were no problems.

> Option 2: It felt that good, didn’t it?

**Nagisa**: …… That’s right. I felt just as good that day as I do today, maybe that’s why I wanted to sleep.

…… While we were talking, I also started to feel sleepy. I don’t plan on going to bed, though, because I’d probably get scolded by Ibara.

> Option 3: I can just imagine the look on his face.

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu. I’m sure he’s like that in front of everyone.

…… Direct and genuine. He doesn’t hesitate to talk to me, so I feel comfortable spending time with him.

**Nagisa**: …… Of course, he was quiet while he was basking in the sun, but Tenma-kun is always really full of energy.

…… He’s always dashing around somewhere and smiling, when he looks at me I feel like he gives me energy too.

…… That’s probably his personal charm, as well as his charm as an idol.

> Option 1: I understand.

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu. Needless to say, as a producer you understand this more than anyone else.

…… I’m glad that I realized his charm after co-starring with him, and that we became good friends.

> Option 2: Sometimes I get worried……

**Nagisa**: …… That he’s so full of energy that he might get hurt?

…… Certainly, that’s a concern. I’ll also be careful when I’m with him.

> Option 3: You’re good friends, aren’t you?

**Nagisa**: …… If you ask me, I think so. We’ve become good friends since we worked together as Team God.

…… We even went shopping together. At that time, Tenma-kun was full of energy and told me stories about his favorite bread.
