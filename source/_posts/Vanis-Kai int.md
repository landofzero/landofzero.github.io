# First Story

**Vanis**: Hey, Kai. What are you making?

**Kai**: Ah, Ras-nii-san……! I’m doing the same thing as always. I’m making a plushie……

**Vanis**: You’re doing it as skillfully as always.

**Kai**: Really? Thank you.

**Vanis**: You’ve really loved stuffed animals since you were a child, haven’t you.

**Kai**: The plushie that Ras-nii-san left me— I’ll always cherish it.

**Vanis**: That makes me glad.

**Kai**: Even now I still remember you playing with stuffed animals when we were kids.

**Vanis**: Ah, that happened too, didn’t it. …… How nostalgic.

It truly was a very happy time for me since you showed me your smile then.

**Kai**: …… Ras-nii-san…… Are you really not coming back here?

**Vanis**: …… I’ll come and meet you here again. It would make me happy if you would continue to cherish your stuffed animals.

**Kai**: Of course.

**Vanis**: Then, I’ll be going. See you later, Kai.

**Kai**: …… Yeah, see you later.

# Second Story

**Kai**: And do this right here……

**Vanis**: What are you making?

**Kai**: Ah, Ras-nii-san. I’m making new clothes that I can give to my plushies.

**Vanis**: That’s good. I think that fabric is a really nice color.

**Kai**: Thank you. …… Are you doing well over there?

**Vanis**: Yes, I’m taking it easy. Once you get used to the demon world, it’s surprisingly easy to live in.

What about you?

**Kai**: Mere-sama is always disappearing suddenly, and Tis is doing nothing but playing around……

But everyone is doing well.

**Vanis**: I see. That’s a relief.

**Kai**: …… Coming back… is it difficult?

**Vanis**: Yes, I suppose it is a bit difficult.

But, like this, we can still be together. Hey, let’s make a new set of western-style doll clothes.

**Kai**: …… Okay.
