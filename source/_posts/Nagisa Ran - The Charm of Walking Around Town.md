(Location: Kinkakuji)

**Nagisa**: …… According to the weather forecast I saw yesterday, it’s supposed to rain on and off today.

…… But it’s a beautiful sunny day, isn’t it? It’s a relief that the weather doesn’t look like it’ll interfere with the recording♪

…… Aren’t you cold, Anzu-san? The weather is nice, but the wind is chilly, isn’t it?.

> Option 1: I’m fine!

**Nagisa**: …… That’s good. I was concerned since you looked like you weren’t wearing that many layers.

…… Heeh, did you bring a hand warmer with you? You’re very prepared.

> Option 2: Just a little……

**Nagisa**: …… Let’s ask the staff if they have any spare winter clothes.

…… You’re not that cold? If it’s cold, I can lend you my jacket.

> Option 3: As long as I keep moving, things will be fine!

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu, what an energetic reply.

…… But don’t push yourself too hard. It’d be a shame if you came to Kyoto and caught a cold.

(Location: Kinkakuji)

**Nagisa**: …… Is this matcha chocolate? Are you giving it to me?

…… Heeh, it was sold at a nearby store, was it? Thank you.

…… Yes, the matcha flavor deliciously spreads throughout my mouth.

> Option 1: I’m glad it tasted good.

**Nagisa**: …… It says on the package that it’s only available locally.

…… It’s a new discovery to find out there’s sweets with flavors like these tied to local specialties.

> Option 2: There’s more.

**Nagisa**: …… Is that so? Then, I’ll have another one.

…… Fufu, with just the right amount of bitterness, I feel like I could eat as many as I want.

> Option 3: Looks like it’ll be good to buy as a souvenir.

**Nagisa**: …… That’s right. I’m planning to buy some after the shoot is finished. Let’s make this a souvenir for Ibara and Hiyori-kun.

…… I hope they’ll both be happy with it.

(Location: Kinkakuji)

**Nagisa**: …… Nevertheless, it’s fun just to walk around Kyoto.

…… There’s many temples and shrines around the town, including Kinkakuji, and there are stone monuments downtown marking where famous people died.

…… I get to see glimpses of history in various places, so it’s very enriching outside of work.

> Option 1: I’m glad we came to Kyoto.

**Nagisa**: …… Yes, it’s something I’d like to suggest again in the future.

…… Everyone seems to be having fun, and I’m enjoying the fun of the excursion.

> Option 2: I’d like to come back outside of work.

**Nagisa**: …… I would too. I’d like to spend a few days leisurely exploring the city.

…… There’s so many fascinating places that it’s unlikely you could visit them all in one day.

> Option 3: I had fun too.

**Nagisa**: …… Anzu-san also seems attracted to the historical appeal of Kyoto.

…… If you have time, let’s take a walk through the town together.
