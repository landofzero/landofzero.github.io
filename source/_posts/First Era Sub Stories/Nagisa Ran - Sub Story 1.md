**Writer**: Akira

**Season**: Autumn

<!-- more -->

(Setting: Outside the main gate)

**Nagisa**: (……

…… It’s been a long time, Yumenosaki Academy

…… It hasn’t changed at all. No- it seems livelier than when I was here last.

…… Everyone is smiling.

…… That’s good.

………)

……? You there, is there something you need?

…… Eh, Anzu-san? The producer, Anzu-san?

…… I wonder if you came to fetch me?

…… Wait.

…… (Reading from some kind of booklet)

…… Thank you for waiting. Umm~

“Good work coming to get me.”

“I am Shuuetsu Academy’s ruler, Adam’s own Ran Nagisa”

…… Pause.

“Every idol besides me will perish”

…… Ah, wait.

…… It said to look intimidating to my utmost ability. And to laugh loudly too, I suppose?

…… I’ll restart, sorry.

“Fuhahahaha! Every idol besides me will perish!”

“There is no path ahead of me, for my trail paves the path! I am the king of kings!”

“Kneel, you imbeciles! Before the brilliance of Ran Nagisa! Fuhahahaha!”

……… Nailed it. (Victory pose)

…… Ah, sorry. You must have been surprised. I’m in the process of building my character.

…… But I’m not used to it yet, I’m still practicing.

…… I withdrew from idol activities for a while.

…… Wandering around foreign countries on an introspective journey.

…… But in the process, I lost my “self” instead.

…… For a short time I even forgot how to speak Japanese.

…… But Hiyori-kun asked me, “Let’s do our best together again.”

……  That’s why I returned to this country.

…… Honestly, I wasn’t fond of doing so.

…… Both back then and now, the idol industry has always been brutal.

…… I don’t wish to fight others.

…… I wonder why we can’t all get along.

…… Why can’t we all love and watch over each other.

…… Even though we’re family, all born onto the same planet.

…… I wonder, is it because we’re weak?

…… Ah, sorry. You don’t have to be concerned about that, Anzu-san.

…… Um. Could you show me to the student council room?

…… Yes, I thought I’d visit for a greeting before Autumn Live.

…… The venue seems to be our territory.

…… Maybe it’d be more conventional for them to greet us.

…… I’ve been absent from this country for a while.

…… So I wanted to see, feel, and grasp the current atmosphere of Yumenosaki.

…… I felt it’d only be proper that I should come by for a greeting since we’ll be borrowing those Yumenosaki children.

…… I wish to see Eichi-kun as well.

…… That one tends to be cunning. So I have to meet him face-to-face to decipher what he’s thinking.

…… Additionally, it’d be awkward to meet him only after everything’s ended.

…… So I think I should apologize in advance.

…… Trickstar, was it? The group we’re performing a joint live with.

…… I want to tell him, I’m sorry if I break those children.

………

…… What is it? Please, guide me to the student council room.

…… I used to attend Yumenosaki Academy as well, but I’ve forgotten almost everything to do with it.

…… If you don’t lead me there, I’ll get lost.

…… I get lost easily. Rather, I get entranced easily.

…… I wonder if I’m too empty. I lack many things.

…… I trust you’ll guide me properly.

…… Come, let’s go.

…… Umm.

…… Sorry, what was your name again?
