**Writer**: Akira

**Season**: Autumn

<!-- more -->

(Location: In front of the fountain)

**Nagisa**: Good afternoon.

…… We seem to keep running into each other. Um, Anzu-san, was it?

…… You and I, we seem to have some kind of connection.

…… Ah, one moment. We may need to start over– I forgot to act in-character.

…… Eh, I don’t need to act in-character? It just confuses you?

…… Is that so? I’m glad you said that, it gets tiresome to act as someone I’m not.

…… Anyways, I’m sorry but could you guide me to the student council room?

…… I forgot the directions once again. I apologize for the inconvenience.

…… The driver Ibara sent me only took me as far as the Yumenosaki front gate.

…… However, it’s a violation of the school’s rules to enter the campus in a vehicle.

…… Eh? It’s okay to bring in cars and motorbikes now?

…… Ah, I see– the rules were revised. I forgot.

…… I’m hopeless, I have to remember to renew my memory more often

**Tsumugi**: Huh? Uwah, could it be? Nagisa-kun?

**Nagisa**: …… Hm? Ah, it’s Tsumugi-kun.

…… It’s been quite some time. I’m glad, you look well.

**Tsumugi**: That should be my line! I’m glad you’re doing well, Nagisa-kun~♪

What are you doing here? Are you enrolling back into Yumenosaki Academy because you couldn’t bear being at Shuuetsu Academy anymore?

No, of course not. Adam, or rather Eden, seems to be very popular.

I’m a little anxious, it seems like all my old friends are getting out of reach.

**Nagisa**: …… I wonder? I don’t know much regarding social standing, I don’t really care about it.

…… More importantly, I have business in the student council room.

**Tsumugi**: Ah, did you get lost again?

That’s no good at all~, you need to learn to do these things properly! If you keep leaving things to other people then you’ll just be a difficult person to be around!

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. I know, but I can’t seem to care.

**Tsumugi**: Fufu. As expected of Nagisa-kun~. Well, if you’re okay with it, I’ll take you to the student council room. Come on, right this way~♪

**Nagisa**: …… Thank you. You’re as kind as ever, Tsumugi-kun.

……  So that’s how it is. Sorry, I’ll have Tsumugi-kun guide me to the student council room.

…… You can go now, Anzu-san. I apologize for taking up your time.

…… See you again? If fate brings us together again in a different place.

(Location: Student council room)

**Tsumugi**: Pardon me~

**Eichi**: Hm? Oh, Tsumugi…… Wh-What’s wrong? Do you need something from the student council?

**Tsumugi**: Why are you acting a little suspicious, Eichi-kun? I don’t need anything myself, I found Nagisa-kun wandering the campus so I led him here.

**Hiyori**: Nagisa-kun? Nagisa-kun is here? Uwah, what fine weather……☆

**Tsumugi**: Huh– Hiyori-kun?! What are you doing here? Is today maybe a former fine reunion or something?

I-I wasn’t told about this……!

**Eichi**: No, no. It’s merely a coincidence, maybe. At least I hadn’t planned things this way…… What kind of twist of fate is this, really?

Anyway, Nagisa-kun, you don’t have to keep standing there. Come in.

I’ve just prepared some tea, so how about we rekindle our old friendships over some drinks. Let’s have a fun chat and let the flowers of old memories bloom.

**Hiyori**: Eh~? Sounds like it’ll get too dark so count me out!

Instead, let’s talk about something way brighter and more lovely, like how I’m secretly raising a puppy Jun-kun found!

**Nagisa**: …… Does Hiyori-kun’s dorm allow pets?

**Hiyori**:  No, not really actually? But that puppy was just way too cute!

It was so pitifully weak, and it would be quite a shame to just abandon it, so I’ve been doing my best to raise it and hide it from the dorm mother!

Look look, I took a ton of pictures! Her name is Bloody Mary……☆

**Nagisa**: …… It’s not good to break the rules. Although I can’t really talk down to others about that.

…… That’s why you’re stuck in Reimei Academy forever.

…… I want Hiyori-kun to heed the rules better so you can be properly evaluated and enroll in Shuuetsu Academy with me.

**Hiyori**: I can’t do that. I don’t think Jun-kun fits the requirements to do the same quite yet?

Until that child is ready, I’ll be right by his side to care for him!

**Nagisa**: …… Who’s more important, me or Jun?

**Hiyori**: You’re both important to me so it’s a difficult question! Well, at least we can see each other whenever we work as Eden so I hope you’ll be patient and bear with the loneliness for a little♪

**Eichi**: Fufu. You both still seem so close.

**Hiyori**: Because we’re lifelong companions, of course! Eichi-kun and Tsumugi-kun are the opposite though, things have gotten pretty strained haven’t they? You two haven’t met eyes in a while, what foul weather……!

**Eichi**: You’re definitely touching a sore spot. It’s been a while since we’ve talked like this so it can’t be helped that things are awkward…… Right, Tsumugi?

**Tsumugi**: Well, I guess so. More importantly though, what are Hiyori-kun and Nagisa-kun doing here?

I can’t help but wonder if you’re up to your strange schemes again…… Eichi-kun?

**Eichi**: How untrusting of you. No, Hiyori-kun just stopped by since he happened to be nearby.

I was surprised by how sudden it was, I wish you’d give me some kind of notice in advance.

**Hiyori**: Well, I did this based merely on a whim! I heard that Trickstar will be holding a live today!

I came to see how much they’ve grown since that summer♪

**Nagisa**: …… That’s right, Trickstar. I also came to see those children perform.

…… Since we’ll be working together soon, I wished to see how much value they hold.

**Hiyori**: Ah, I think it’s difficult to know their value by just looking at them! Those kids have a bright future before them– they’ve become favorites of mine♪

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. Hiyori-kun has been praising them a lot so I got curious.

**Eichi**: Fufu. Well, let’s go watch it together then. I’ll prepare special seats for us.

**Tsumugi**: Um. By any chance would that “us” include me?

**Eichi**: Of course. The central characters of the former fine, who long ago reformed Yumenosaki Academy, will gather to watch the heroes of the present age……

It paints quite the fine image, doesn’t it?

As expected, it ties my stomach in knots, and with Trickstar performing on stage it may make things more difficult for them……

Well, how about we put pressure on them as their predecessors?

**Nagisa**: …… I’m good at exuding pressure. Or rather, I’ve been practicing that as Ibara told me to.

**Hiyori**: Ahaha☆ You’ve been working hard on things that don’t really make sense, Nagisa-kun!

What sets you apart is that you take it in as your own flesh and blood where others may get lost!

**Nagisa**: …… I don’t dislike putting in effort for work or studying. I find it fun to explore uncharted territories for a way forward.

…… I hope that I can continue doing that forever.

…… The former fine didn’t leave any room for that, so I left.

…… After the conquest of Yumenosaki Academy, there was nothing left to discover.

…… After judging as such, I ended it, however…

…… In this school where dreams bloom, it seems a fun story has once again begun.
