**Ibara**: Your Excellency~! Come, let’s celebrate Christmas! It’s called Jingle Be~lls!

**Nagisa**: …… Christmas. Is Christmas delicious?

**Ibara**: Ahaha ♪ His Excellency says some interesting things!

You could say that Christmas in Japan is delicious since it’s celebrated with cake! Do you like cake, Your Excellency?

**Nagisa**: …… I don’t know. I would eat it if it were served but if you asked me if I liked it or not I wouldn’t be able to say.

…… Incidentally, Ibara, why are we dressed like this?

**Ibara**: Ahaha ♪ Is that what His Excellency was wondering about?

Oh, how rude of me! I will do my best to answer your question! Salute~☆

**Ibara**: The other day, His Excellency asked “What does a Christmas party entail?” so I prepared to liven things up in my own way!

**Nagisa**: …… Is that so? Sorry, I can’t recall.

…… But Ibara remembered and prepared. Thank you. 

**Ibara**: No, not at all! Cake and food is available but if it’s not needed we can toss it in the trash!

**Nagisa**: …… After you went through the trouble to prepare it, it’d be a waste to throw it away.

…… Ah, Ibara. Look outside, it’s snowing.

**Ibara**: Ah, this is magnificent! What a perfect situation! No, it’s romantic!

However, it’s inexcusable that a filthy person such as myself is watching this with you! Please excuse me while I go jump out a window!

**Nagisa**: …… No, I don’t want you to do such a thing.

…… Ibara, I’m happy to celebrate Christmas with you like this. And I hope you feel the same way.

**Ibara**: Of course! I’m truly lucky to be able to celebrate Christmas with His Excellency……☆ Here, have some cake~!

**Nagisa**: …… Thank you.

…… Ah, how pleasant.
