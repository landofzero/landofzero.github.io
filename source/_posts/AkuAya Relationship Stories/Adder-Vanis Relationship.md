# Chapter 1

**Vanis**: ………

Hey, Adder. You’re busy today too, huh. As expected of Belladonna’s head of house.

**Adder**: You have spare time today too it seems. Are you gracefully napping like a freeloader?

**Vanis**: Oya, how unexpected. It’s not that I have free time.

I was waiting because I thought I’d be able to meet you right away if I stayed here.

**Adder**: If there’s something you have to say, come to my room. Don’t fake an ambush.

**Vanis**: Since we were able to meet like this, wouldn’t you like to hear the details anyway? It’s something that has to do with you…… It’s about mana.

**Adder**: Don’t tell me you’re hungry because you don’t have enough mana.

**Vanis**: It was unexpected. I’ve been having trouble acquiring pure mana lately.

Won’t you help me out with it? With the power of the great House Belladonna.

**Adder**: …… That’s a fairly naive statement, you know. If you’re that hungry, you can just eat human souls.

**Vanis**: How awful, even though you know how things work. Didn’t I tell you? As a fallen angel, I need to extract mana from humans without killing them.

**Adder**: You haven’t forgotten that just because you’re staying in House Belladonna, you won’t be getting any special treatment, have you?

Why don’t you handle your own living expenses? I’m sure you’ve got a plan.

**Vanis**: …… What do you mean by that?

**Adder**: You can be thankful that I’m not pressing this further. I suppose you’ll have to ask your many patrons to do something about it.

If you have nothing else to say, then I’m leaving.

**Vanis**: …… Ahh, I’m in trouble. If I starve to death, I wonder what will become of Adder’s position.

**Adder**: —Is there something you want to say?

**Vanis**: If that happened…… I think it would be very troublesome.

I wonder if a scary demon would say something about it? Like…… For example, your father.

**Adder**: ………

**Vanis**: He’s the most troublesome existence in the demon world. Even though you’re not afraid of anything, he’s still the most troublesome opponent for you. It’s scary just to think about.

**Adder**: Heh…… Kukuku. I wonder what you were saying, are you trying to threaten me with something like that?

**Vanis**: …… Heeh, how can you say that I’m just speaking without thinking?

**Adder**: Even if one freeloader died, that man wouldn’t think anything of it. Even if that freeloader happened to be a rare fallen angel.

And it’s the same for me. If you die from not eating enough mana, then you’re not worth using to begin with. I don’t care if that kind of person disappears.

**Vanis**: Both Adder and his father are cold.

(Adder moves in closer)

**Adder**: …… I’m telling you this because it’s a good opportunity.

—You can charm smarter people, right?

**Vanis**: ………

(Adder backs away)

**Adder**: If you want your food, show me a better performance. Until that happens, you’ll stay hungry.

**Vanis**: A better performance, huh…… Good grief, it’s that easy, isn’t it?

# Chapter 2

**Adder**: …… How much rations do we have left?

**Servant**: It would probably be enough for two months when distributed to all the servants.

**Adder**: I see. Then, for now let’s harvest the souls of all the humans we’ve captured.

**Servant**: Certainly.

**Adder**: …… We’ll need to replenish our supplies above ground soon. I wonder if I should let that Rosé go. You better get ready too.

**Servant**: Understood.

**Vanis**: You’re always so enthusiastic about your work, aren’t you.

**Adder**: Don’t enter without permission. Since you’re a freeloader, why don’t you show some basic courtesy?

**Vanis**: That was impolite. But, when I’m hungry, I just don’t have the time.

**Adder**: What? You’re hungry again and come here to beg for food?

**Vanis**: I’ve given up on that. I’m thankful just being able to live in your home.

Today, I have something you’d like to hear.

The servants were making a fuss about it earlier. The number of captured humans and the number of souls harvested don’t match.

**Adder**: What?

**Vanis**: The servant earlier said that there was only two months worth of rations left, but didn’t it decrease too quickly?

**Adder**: (Internally) Certainly…… They must have captured a sufficient number of people.

**Vanis**: Well, I’m sure there’ll be a report on it soon, but since I happened to hear about it, I thought I’d let you know right away.

**Adder**: Hmph, what special consideration from a freeloader.

**Vanis**: Are you willing to give me mana now?

**Adder**: Don’t get carried away. You were just reporting on the situation that’s happening among the servants.

**Vanis**: It was a joke. Well, of course if I could receive mana that would be better.

**Adder**: If you have time to spout nonsense then you have time to find some mana yourself.

**Vanis**: Yes, yes. Then, excuse me.

(Internally) …… Alright, this is good.

(Internally) That senior aristocrat was the perfect tool for a better performance.

(Flashback)

**Vanis**: To be able to collect so many souls…… I’m sure you know of a good hunting ground.

**Senior Aristocrat**: Hehehe, it wasn’t hunting.

It was presented to me by a servant from a certain family. The family where someone wrapped around my finger lurks.

**Vanis**: Well, well, well. How scary. If I do something incorrectly, my life might be in danger.

**Senior Aristocrat**: Hehehehe……

**Vanis**: (Internally) Don’t talk so proudly and glibly when flattering me…… Don’t worry about me being in Belladonna.

(End Flashback)

**Vanis**: (Internally) —I was the one who told the servants about the problem. In other words, Adder was able to figure out the issue early thanks to me.

(Internally) However, I won’t dare tell him “it’s all thanks to me.” That way, he would have received my help without realizing it.

(Internally) Things will continue on like this, and one day he’ll realize the truth, and come to know just how thankful I am.

(Internally) By then, I’ll already be your favorite. I’m sure you’ll become a convenient pawn for me.

# Chapter 3

**Vanis**: ………

(Internally) As expected, I’m starting to feel hungry…… It doesn’t seem like I can expect much from Adder, so I might have to rely on some other noble……?

**Adder**: …… Are you sleeping again this time? Your reputation is as good as ever.

**Vanis**: You don’t need to worry one bit. I don’t feel like disturbing your work today.  Don’t have that much energy.

**Adder**: I have something for you. Take it.

**Vanis**: ……?

**Adder**: Open it. 

**Vanis**: This is…… pure mana……?

**Adder**: This is all you need.

**Vanis**: Wait, Adder. Why did you suddenly change your mind?

**Adder**: You’re just like that angel in that you feign ignorance and don’t show your true feelings.

**Vanis**: …… That angel?

**Adder**: Heh, wouldn’t it be kinder to go ahead and say “Mere” to the incompetent freeloader?

**Vanis**: ………

**Adder**: You were the one who told the servants the number of souls didn’t match, weren’t you?

**Vanis**: (Internally) ……! He already noticed……?

…… What makes you think so?

**Adder**: I swiftly figured out who was stealing the souls. It was easy to make him spit out that he was the dog of that senior aristocrat.

And I know you’ve often been hanging around that senior aristocrat lately.

**Vanis**: (Internally) …… He found out this much in such a short amount of time? Moreover, he was aware that I was on good terms with that aristocrat.

(Internally) Good job, Adder. I underestimated you. It’s my loss this time.

Haha, I can’t compete with you. As expected, you truly are the head of House Belladonna. You can see everything this freeloader does.

**Adder**: You also did a good job for a freeloader. So I’m giving you mana as a reward.

**Vanis**: (Internally) …… But by forcing me to take the reward, you’re saying you don’t owe me anything, right?

(Internally) I’ll be paid the exact amount for the work I do, and there will be no trouble in the future. The only reason you keep me by your side is because we have the same interests. 

(Internally) He’s thorough. It seems like he has no intention of being indebted to me.

I didn’t tell you because I dislike being patronizing, so it’s a shame you found out.

**Adder**: Hmph. I guessed you were secretly planning on expressing your gratitude to us all at once. Which is more effective for putting us in your debt.

**Vanis**: It can’t be helped if I was that obvious. It’s not so easy to win over the head of Belladonna.

But maybe one day I’ll win you over and destroy you? Is it really okay to keep such a dangerous being in this house?

**Adder**: Dangerous? Heh, then isn’t this a security error?

**Vanis**: …… Huh?

**Adder**: As long as you make light of me and try to manipulate me, you won’t be a real threat. It’s just wasted effort. At best, you’re devising strategies as you please.

**Vanis**: …… You’re talking pretty big aren’t you. Well, I’ll take your word for it and let you go.

Because it’s convenient for me to be in Belladonna.

**Adder**: Do as you please.
