# Prologue

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/teorw64o.png">

(Location: ES Hallway)

(One day during the first thirds of February (1). Corridor in front of the NewDi office.)

**Natsume**: ……PheW, finally the chaos of the end-of-year and New Year period has calmed dowN.

It started with the SS Qualifiers, the new stage for the special program for the end-of-year and New Years SSVRS trial, Maizuru Manor(2)—thougH it feels we’ve been tooting our own horn.

I wondeR if we can finallY return to normal activities.

Now theN. I’ll go beat up the Senpai who is still breaking labor law (3) during the end-of-year and New Years period, and enjoy a belated vacation–

UmM?

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/28lzit88.png">

(Location: NewDi Offices)

**Tsumugi and Ibara**: ………♪

**Natsume**: (“Viper”……!?(4) Why is he herE!?

CoulD it be that he’s trying to imprint something onto Senpai when I’m not therE—)

Ibara-kun. What do you neeD from NewDi?

**Ibara**: So you’ve returned, Natsume-kun ♪ 

I’m sorry to be bothering you! As the representative of CosPro, I’m currently talking to His Majesty the acting director of NewDi, so please don’t worry about it, Natsume-kun ♪ 

**Natsume**: ………!

**Ibara**: My my my! A snake glare! (5) Lately, I tend to be forgetful of the fact that I’m a ‘Viper’, so I’m greatly indebted to your consideration in reminding me of that!

**Natsume**: That isn’T what I’m trying to do. Can you not string me along at your pace like thaT?

Enough with this tedious talk, just say what you want tO say.

**Tsumugi**: Don’t be such a grouch~, Natsume-kun. You know, since another agency’s representative came all the way to NewDi~?

Come on, smile, smile ♪ 

**Natsume**: *Shut up, workaholic.*(6)

*If you don’t rest already, you’re going tO end up in a hospital, you know.*

**Tsumugi**: No way!?

**Ibara**: You seem to be quite irritated~ It looks like you’ve been equally busy!

Well, this isn’t something that needed to be kept a secret, so I’ll let you in on it. I was just thinking of enjoying seeing Natsume-kun being left out in the cold!(7)

**Natsume**: You’re a rotten character, huH.

**Ibara**: AHaHaHa☆ That’s a good look on your face!

Putting that aside. Are you familiar with “NETV (Netteibi)”, Natsume-kun?

**Natsume**: Net……What?

**Ibara**: “NETV” —A recently started streaming broadcasting service that’s aimed at overseas folk.

It can be said that unlike a streaming program that is enormously funded with investments of shares in large quantities, it’s a streaming service from a company from this country with a moderate budget.

While niche, there is a demand from overseas. An Idol programme—- or some such is what “NETV” is trying to produce.

As such, I’m simply here to inquire if NewDi would like to cooperate by arranging participants.

**Tsumugi**: That’s right! Even though Saegusa-kun said it was a ‘moderate budget’ but, from my reading of the plans, the budget allocated is surprisingly quite substantial.

I was thinking that it’s a good chance for a new agency like NewDi.

**Natsume**: How suspiciouS……of this “Viper” to approacH us with talks of work.

There haS to be something else to it. OtherwisE, CosPro would surelY have exclusively monopolized this delicious project.

**Ibara**: What nonsense— to say there is ‘something else’. Just like divination, statistics and calculations are all there is to it.

I’m not trying to make a boring joke like “There is nothing hidden to 'fortune tellers'”— or something. (8) There are some things I haven’t explained, but it’s only because I’m unable to disclose everything.

The truth is, CosPro also has investments in this “NETV”.

It was an old connection from the time around when I was just starting out as a manager. Thanks to that, if the program is not a success, it’ll be a total loss.

In other words, this proposition is an idea meant to at least minimize losses. Because a cross-agency programme would be good publicity.

CosPro is extending the opportunity to participate to NewDi to push the program into success—

How about it? It’s not a bad proposition, right?

**Natsume**: ………

**Tsumugi**: As for me, I’m thinking positively about appearing on “NETV”.

I didn’t get any bad impressions from when I was looking at documents. It felt like it was influenced by a proper production company.

The only problem is, “NETV” is an online internet program, so not a lot of huge agency idols will participate.

……That said though, NewDi isn’t a huge agency.

This is a chance that won’t come again for us as we are right now. Net programs are still in its infancy stages right now, so long established agencies would not be expanding into it.

**Natsume**: ……I seE. ThougH there are undeniably fishy parts to it, it doeS stand to logic.

HoweveR. If you do anything suspicious, I won’T be silent about it.

**Ibara**: My my, please do not say that! Let us be mutually supportive of each other as coworkers in the same job!

Well then, I will be returning on a later date to explain the project! Take care until then!

# The Die Has Been Cast

(Location: Time Street)

**Rinne**: Fuah, fu……Aa~ So sleepy……

So glad that “Beehive”’s a success. Wasn’t expecting it to be so lively till morning, but it turned out to be a good distraction for me.

Now then. My head’s spinning after that all-nighter, so I guess it’s about time for me to go home and sleep.

**Madara**: Good Morniiiiiiiing!

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/saylsht0.png">

**Rinne**: Shut up……!?

What. Are you just coming home from staying out all night? You’re a bad kid, don’t come to me if the police detain you.

**Madara**: Hahaha. My bad, my bad. I saw a familiar face, so, ya know.

I’m just being consistent with SS and wanted to return the favouur!

**Rinne**: Oi oi, are you for real, Mikeneko-chan. (1)

About that, that’s just how that was directed. I can’t compete with someone who goes around raising his voice everywhere.

**Madara**: Mikeneko-chan?

**Rinne**: Isn’t it a good nickname for someone with a free spirit? It’s a cuter name than the dangerous bees that sting people ♪

More importantly. Why are you here? Meeting an idol who roams about in a playground isn’t impressive ya know?

**Madara**: Unfortunately however, I wasn’t out enjoying the nightlife.

Even though MaM’s been feeling like it’s being neglected, lately the jobs have been increasing little by little.

I’ve been loitering around here since morning, trying to take advantage of this momentum and see if it would turn into a job for me.

The shopping district is around here, I’m sure there are lots of people from the industry world who would be returning home in the morning after staying out all night, just like Rinne-san.

**Rinne**: I see. I really thought you stayed up all night and it got you all excited.

But still, feeling neglected by the entertainment business huh…… That sounds pretty familiar.

The world is relentless in so many ways, right? Rinne-kun’s starting to hate it……!

**Madara**: CrazyB’s been feeling neglected too huh. I heard about it a lot from Kohaku-san.

Because I get into trouble every time I take up a job, it feels like I only get handed strange jobs that everyone else would shy away from, or something.

**Rinne**: Yep yep. It’s really horrible. It’s not fun to just be surrounding yourself with people who are goody-two-shoes right?

That’s why I’m rooting for you too, Mikeneko-chan.

’Kay. As an older brother, I’m gonna treat you to a beef bowl!

There’s nothing more delicious to eat than a beef bowl after staying up all night. It’s a farewell gift from me, so eat it! (2)

**Madara**: A beef bowl? No, I’m not particularly hungry.

**Rinne**: What, you’re saying you’re not gonna eat my beef bowl?

You’re so cold~ You’re going to reject this Senpai-in-life who’s really raring to go?

Even though I really wanna go eat some food with Mikeneko-chan~?

**Madara**: I get it, I get it. If you’re insisting that much, I’ll join you.

Mutual fate!(3) Meeting you here must have been some sort of fate. right?

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/532ss75b.png">

(Location: Season Avenue (In Front of Convenience Store))

(30 minutes later)

**Rinne**: I ate, I ate ♪

Wow, after that nourishment resupply, my headache is settling down considerably! Thank you!

**Madara**: Me too. It was a treat.

Well then, it’s about time I get going. I was actually in the middle of a walk, seee.

I’m going to try to find some interesting job or other while on the walk.

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/8eul5dq7.png">

**Madara**: ……Ohh?

**Rinne**: What’s this? Mikeneko-chan, your smartphone and mine are ringing at the same time?

**Madara**: Rinne-san, this is a KiraKira Mail. It seems that a new job request’s come up.

**Rinne**: “Battle on the Sugoroku Board”——A multiple agency inter-agency competition in which idols from CosPro and NewDi will participate in, huh?

It’s “Open World Sugoroku” where you fight using dice…… I don’t get what that means,but basically, you fight in units based on your agency.

I thought we’re finally going to hit it off, but things never go so smoothly, huh.

”Yesterday’s enemy is today’s enemy too” and all that ♪

**Madara**: Hahaha. It’s a fitting curtain call for us.

Looking from the perspective of the SS Final competition, it’s like yesterday’s enemy has come to become an opponent once again.

In any case, this is the new job that we’ve been eagerly waiting for.

It’s disappointing that the objective of my walk was realized in an unexpected way, but I can’t say thaat. Let’s reply to this in a positive way.

**Rinne**: Yeah. Of course I’ll be participating too. It’s sorta rare to get to do jobs from over that side ♪

Welp, I guess it’s time I go home now. Hope you’ll go easy on me the next time we meet ♪

**Madara**: Ah. I’m looking forward to it toooo. Let’s compete fair and square.

**Rinne**: Gyaahaha♪ Coming from you?

Weeell, I’m looking forward to it. In more ways than one ♪

(Location: Meeting room)

(A few days later. “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” project briefing session)

**Hinata**: Heya, Rinne-senpai!

I never thought I’d be able to co-star with other CosPro members! I’m looking forward to the agency competition♪

**Rinne**: Oh, it’s Hina isn’t it. You’re alone today, huh?

I thought you’d be coming as twins since 2wink means “two in one!” or somethin’ like that, doesn’t it?

**Hinata**: Yuuta-kun and I aren’t as “clingy” as we used to be~. This time, since only one person from each unit was needed, I thought it’d be fine if I came.

Ah, the vice prez has also arri~ved. Salute~☆

**Ibara**: Yeah yeah, salute salute.

**Hinata**: Eh- this is terrible! Vice prez~, are you in a bad mood?

**Ibara**: It’s annoying to hear the same topic over and over again. The only thing that can ask for a reaction every time is variety shows.

In any case, all that’s left is for Switch to arrive.

We are slightly past the meeting time. Mikejima-shi, Narukami-shi, have you heard anything?

**Madara**: I don’t know anything about the office, do I?

Even though I took on some odd jobs, I tried not to get involved in the affairs of units or idols.

**Arashi**: I especially haven’t. Lately, Aoba-senpai seems to be in the office whenever I catch a glimpse of him. Maybe Natsume-chan is telling him to take a break……?

**Ibara**: Hmm. In order to give the ever busy Eden a break, I called up one person from each unit.

As a result, it’s not hard to imagine that they’d struggle to decide who will represent Switch.

Well then, shall we proceed with the discussion with the present members?

I’d like to ask someone from NewDi to report the information to Switch—

**Natsume**: ………

**Hinata**: Ah, Sakasaki-senpai! Everyone was worried you wouldn’t come~

**Natsume**: ……… (Ignores him)

**Hinata**: Are you seriously angry!? What happened!?

**Natsume**: What do you mean “what happeNED.” Everyone here knows about “NETV,” don’t you!?

**Arashi**: What do you mean……?

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/1c6k6sev.png">

**Natsume**: It felt odd that “Viper” was offering me a jOB, so I did some research on my oWN.

That’s how it wAS—BinGO. The production director for “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” was previously driven out of the entertainment industry for committing a violent ACT.

**Madara**: Oh? This is my first time hearing about it.

**Natsume**: WeLL, unlike back then he used a business naME, so I couldn’t tell from the letters alONE. I used a contact from the entertainment industry to get to the bottom of thINGS.

Don’t waste your breATH. You knew about that and got NewDi involved, didn’t YOU?

**Ibara**: Ahaha! That’s quite the network you’ve got there~, I’m impressed!

I can’t help but be surprised that you found my proposition to be so suspicious. But what Natsume-kun said is true.

However, don’t you think it’s harsh to be so angry?

**Natsume**: ? What did you sAY?

**Ibara**: The parties involved have already reflected on what happened and have paid the fine. The legal process has come to a close—and the parties have reached a settlement.

This program may be a chance for him to make his return after mending his ways.

It’d be a shame to lose your job because of the echoes of the past, don’t you think?

**Natsume**: The problem iS that he was hiding that faCT.

**Ibara**: I didn’t realize it was “hiding” to be considerate of avoiding unnecessary prying. Vexing, isn’t it~?

Or else what? Individual freedom should be determined entirely by who holds authority at the time?

I suppose I was wrong to think that Natsume-kun, who has always been on the side of the outcasts, wouldn’t take such a stance……♪

**Natsume**: ………

**Rinne**: They’re fighting before it even starts. It’s so hot I can even see the illusion of fireworks.

I agree with ya, that story— he’s paying for his past sins now though, isn’t he?

Then we from Crazy:B will respect that!

**Hinata**: So that’s what you think, Rinne-senpai~. As for me, as long as it’s interesting it’s fine.

From what I’ve seen, the planning for “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” is well done, so it’s okay to go there and make the decision then, isn’t it?

**Madara**: Even then, if he’s still doing bad things, then maybe we can help prevent future bad things from happening.

I’d like to see NETV once too.

**Natsume**: …… I get IT. If I’m being narrow-mindED, I’ll leave it at thAT.

HoweVER, there won’t be a next tIME. This imitation of foul play has made me even more suspiciOUS.

Senpai also wants to participate in this projECT, so I’ll see what I can dig UP.

**Ibara**: Yes, yes. It would be helpful if you could do that!

Personally, I merely sympathize with the fact that his future options were limited because of his past circumstances.

If something were to happen during “Battle on the Sugoroku Board,” I would immediately pull out all of CosPro’s idols!

Now then, let’s get into the explanation of “Battle on the Sugoroku Board!” Thank you for your attention……☆

## 3

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/t8atexdh.png">

(Location: Meeting room)

**Ibara**: Firstly, concerning the basic rules for the “Battle of the Sugoroku Board”. The “Battle of the Sugoroku Board” is a new variety show project in which there is neither the concept of turns nor the concept of a goal.

You’ll move around as you please in a massive set, battling idols from the enemy team based on the throw of dice– this is what the project called “Open World Sugoroku” is.

**Hinata**: I was surprised when I saw the pictures of the set, though. Seems like online programs have huge budgets, huh~ It looks like it’s pretty large-scale.

To be honest, the set feels a lot bigger than those of the majority of other TV shows. But even then idols from other major agencies aren’t participating, huh?

**Ibara**: Ahaha. You’ve completely fallen for the snare, Hinata-kun!

**Hinata**: Eh?

**Ibara**: It might look luxurious, but it’s recycled from the set of the end-of-year special program that would otherwise be disposed of. Since it’s meant to be broadcast for the overseas audience, we can cheat their sense of seasonality.

The ES idols who were furiously dedicated to “SS” would have no way of knowing.

Of course, it’s been repainted so that it would not be amiss even from a living room.

**Madara**: Overseas,  there is the Lunar New Year……There’s a culture of celebrating a full-blown New Year in February, you knoow. For the overseas audience, this would be the focus. (1) 

**Hinata**: Eh~, I was kind of impressed, but now the feeling’s gone.

**Ibara**: From the outset, since this is a developing media, we can’t bet on a large budget for it.

**Natsume**: “Open World Sugoroku”……I was worried that jusT the name was going to be an exaggeration.

But you caN say that it’s what it says on the tin. (2) If that’s the case, I have nO objections.

**Arashi**: Yes. It really is a decent project plan. But I’m a little concerned about what the production director was saying.

Even though this show called it “Sugoroku”. The truth is, you battle through rolling your dice for the highest number.

**Ibara**: Yes. It was briefly touched upon in the project proposal, but I will explain it once more.

While on set, when you encounter an idol hailing from the enemy team, a “Dice Battle” will commence. Both sides will roll their dice, and the side that rolls the highest number wins.

Defeated idols will be in “State of Surrender”, and will be sent to a cage provided on set.

Furthermore, at that moment, you will be made to choose between submitting all the money you have on hand, or to hand over the support items you have.

It’s exactly like being a prisoner of war. Idols inside the cage can be revived by their friends using the on-hand in-game currency— which is called “Gold”.

Speaking of which. You can use the support items to check the location of your friends in the app developed for the “Battle on the Sugoroku Board”, so please make full use of it when you’re fighting.

Lastly, about the field we’re going to use. After a certain amount of time has passed, a majority of the exploration area will become a no-entry area.

Idols who enter the no-entry area will be disqualified, and there’s no use arguing otherwise. You won’t be able to hide forever, so please be careful.

…… And those are the rules of the “Battle on the Sugoroku Board”. Are there any questions?

**Rinne**: Hold on, Hebi-chan.(3) You haven’t explained the important part, right?

**Ibara**: What is it?

**Rinne**: Oi oi, even now you still don’t get it~ How coy ♪

It’s common sense that you’ll get a big prize if you win in a variety show like this!

Don’t put on airs and just tell us. It’s such a large-scale show. There’s a gorgeous reward prepared that’s enough to make me fall over, right?

**Ibara**: There isn’t.

**Rinne**: Huh?

**Ibara**: Unfortunately, there is no budget for something like that……

In return, there’s a “Punishment game” for the agency that loses!

**Arashi**: Oh dear. There aren’t any prizes, but you prepared a punishment game……?

Even if there’s no budget, isn’t this pretty harsh?

**Ibara**: Yes. I’m sorry I can’t meet your expectations.

Almost all of the budget is spent on production costs, including the set and idol-appearance costs, so there was not much budget left for prizes. 

**Rinne**: Nope nope, that’ll be a loss of earnings!

**Ibara**: Now, now, don’t say that! It’s painful for me too, but that’s why online shows are a dream!

Existing TV broadcasts have limited programming time, but there are no such restrictions in streaming, and if it gets popular, it’s easy to turn into a namesake program.

What’s more, considering sponsors is not as annoying as over-the-air TV. 

In that sense, it really might not be a bad deal for Crazy:B, who faces fierce public criticism ♪

**Natsume**: Prizes, huH……. It might be better thaN being made to run with a carrot dangling in front of you, huH.

In any casE, if you do well on the show, the rewards will follOW later.

It’s more importanT for me to know that this program is being managed properly or not. 

**Madara**: It’s a low-budget program to begin with. It’ll feel weeeird if we get all excited about getting stuff.

It’s not a bad thing to play to avoid Punishment games once in a while.

**Arashi**: That’s fine, but I want to know what the Punishment game will be……?

It definitely won’t be anything we would say is a no go, right?

If it’s like a modern program, there’d be something like ‘compliance’ or something. Are the net shows fine? They won’t make us do weird things like in those old shows, will they?

**Hinata**: Oh yeah~ I’m worried too.

I haven’t seen stuff like that on TV shows lately, so I think it should be fine.

Even though I heard there was Punishment game that didn’t suit the times happening, like when someone had to parade around town while crossdressing— ♪

**Ibara**: Hinata-kun, what are you talking about?

**Hinata**: It has nothing to do with you, Vice Pres! It’s about an old TV show!

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/ftb8hext.png">

**Ibara**: ……Ahem! (clears throat)

Anyway. If I get mixed up in a cruel Punishment game, it’ll be like putting the cart before the horse, therefore I will take up the responsibility of supervising it.

Let’s have fun fighting and make a variety show that could be enjoyed with laughter in a Japanese style living room.

There aren’t any other questions, I take it? This concludes this joint-office project briefing session.

I’m looking forward to meeting all of your energetic selves on the day of recording. May the fortunes of war be with you…… ♪

(Location: “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” program set)

(A few days later. “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” recording day)

**Tsumugi**: So this is the set for “Battle on the Sugoroku Board?”~ It’s a wonderful set, isn’t it. It’s a real spectacle!

Don’t you think so, Natsume-kun?

**Natsume**: ………

**Tsumugi**: Huh, what’s wrong Natsume-kun? O~i?

**Natsume**: I can’t even begin to express my disgUST.

I told you the other day, you should rest at Starmony DoRMS. Didn’t you hear what I saID?

I mean. Why is Senpai wearing the “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” costUME?

You’re not planning on making an appearance, are yOU……?

**Tsumugi**: Ahaha. It looked like they had spare costumes, so I picked it up out of habit……

Don’t worry. I won’t be on the show.

Today’s my day off, so I thought I’d come see “Battle on the Sugoroku Board”♪

Seeing everyone working hard also filled me with energy.

**Natsume**: ………

**Ibara**: Well well, isn’t this wonderful, Natsume-kun!

Even if workaholics are ordered to stay at home, they’ll end up doing paperwork that can be done from home. So it may be less of a burden to just relax outside.

I’m in the same category so, yes, I understand.

**Tsumugi**: That’s right, isn’t it~♪ You understand!

**Arashi**: They’re fellow workaholics, huh.

**Natsume**: They’ll both work themselves to deATH.

**Tsumugi**: Please stop saying stuff like that~

I think I have a good balance, don’t I? I just have a bigger workload than other people, but I still have a good work-life balance.

I just came here today as a fan to watch everyone compete in “Battle on the Sugoroku Board,” so don’t worry.

**Natsume**: I can’t not worRY.

HoweVER, actually being here made me realize, this place is very spacioUS—

There are quite a few participants besides NewDi and CosPro. At first glance, it looks like ten or so agencies are participating.

**Arashi**: It was limited to three people per agency— I think. Now that I think about it, it looks like a whole class of idols have gathered together.

**Ibara**: Indeed. It’s very difficult to survive in this situation.

If it’s a performance contest for idols, then the ES agencies have an advantage. But if it’s a variety show showdown, any team may have a chance of winning.

We too must take heed.

Otherwise, you’ll be subject to the punishment game that’ll be announced soon.

**Madara**: That won’t matter if we win the war, Ibara-san.

It looks like some other CosPro guys are arguing with each other over there, but is it fine to just leave things be? Things seem to be going downhill before the game even starts.

**Ibara**: What……? Ah, yes that’s fine. It seems to be business as usual, so…

**Yuuta**: Get away, don’t get familiar with me!

**Rinne**: Gyahaha♪ Don’t be so grumpy♪

Hina wasn’t able to come, so let’s get along well♪ C’mon, Yuta!

**Yuuta**: Uwah, don’t come closer! You’re gonna infect me, you gambler……!

Vice prez, please do something about this guy!

**Ibara**: Fufu. It was a great misfortune, wasn’t it. I didn’t expect that a healthy child like Hinata-kun would be absent due to a sudden cold.

**Yuuta**: It really is troublesome…… In the past it was the same when I caught a cold, and that was a pain. But I didn’t think it would cause problems in such a place……

And then, I never thought I’d be teamed up with Rinne-senpai! If he comes within a 5 meter radius, I’ll kick him!

**Rinne**: Nice, a rebellious streak! You can’t stand me but can’t help but love me☆

**Yuuta**: That’s why I’m telling you to stay away……!

**Madara**: Hahaha. It’s great that you’re such good friendsss♪

…… Oh– while I was rambling on, it looks like the staff finished preparing.

The production director is on stage, but what’ll happen next?

**Natsume**: It looks like we’re going to go over the rules again and explain the punishment gaME.

The punishment game is “extremely bitter healthy mixed juiCE?”

**Tsumugi**: Heeh. It’s a drink made from the juice of nutritious vegetables like nalta jute and bitter gourd?

It tastes bitter but can be healthy……. Huh? May I try some?

**Natsume**: Are you seriOUS?

**Tsumugi**: Yes. Natsume-kun also said so, right? It’s bad if all I do is work.

It might be a good idea to pay attention to my health and try a drink like this once in a while♪

Gulp, gulp…… Fuahh♪

Yep, it tastes healthy and delicious!

**Natsume**: “DeliciOUS?” That doesn’t seem like a punishment gAME……

**Ibara**: Hmm. That’s strange, I didn’t plan on that.

**Tsumugi**: Ahaha. Isn’t that the kind of TV-like reaction people are looking for?

You see, a typical hot water bath doesn’t actually have really boiling water in it, it just has slightly warmer water—

If you’re interested, you might want to try drinking a bit. How is it?

**Natsume**: This stenCH…… ACK, COUGH!

That feeling of discomfort from getting in its vicinity…… It’s terrifyING. Wouldn’t it be better to have someone who looks unhealthy drink IT……!?

**Ibara**: In that case, I believe Rinne Amagi-shi is the right person!

**Rinne**: Why me!?

**Ibara**: Now, now, you want to have a good role on the show, don’t you? Then maybe Crazy:B could have its own show! Come on, drink up!

**Rinne**: Wait– gimme gimme! Ugh, it tastes disgusting……!

**Tsumugi**: What? I thought it was really delicious……!

**Natsume**: I didn’t expect Senpai’s insensitivity to reach this leVEL.

**Arashi**: Mama. Avoid the punishment game at all costs.

**Madara**: Yeah. No matter how many variety shows you can appear on, it’s not worth it.

**Yuuta**: I don’t want to drink something that suspicious either……

**Ibara**: Fufu, everyone now understands how scary the “extremely bitter healthy mixed juice” is! Thanks to you, it looks like the battle will be desperate!

Now, it’s time for the game to begin.

“Battle on the Sugoroku Board”—ready… START!

## 5

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/lfclqe76.png">

(Location: “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” program set)

(Immediately after the start of “Battle on the Sugoroku Board..” NewDi Team’s starting point)

**Tsumugi**: Natsume-ku\~n, please do your best\~♪

**Natsume**: Yes, yES. Then, you just go wait in the bleachERS.

AH, it seems footage of various teams are being cast to the bleachers, so don’t be so careless with your reactions when you see the NewDi Team.

This game turns into a “dice battle” every time you encounter an opponENT, so I think it’d be better to hide for a whiLE—

Since no one’s familiar with the whole game area, it might be a good idea to look at our surroundings firST.

It’s the golden rule of FPS to find a place to hide without moving too carelessLY.

**Madara**: FPS……?

**Natsume**: First person shooter game. A game where you fight enemies with a fireaRM.

A more familiar example might be something like a survival gAME. RegardlESS, there’s risk of harm if you approach the enemy, so it’s best to stay hidden for a whILE—

Of courSE, we’ll be in trouble if we just keep hiding all the tiME, so let’s split up and search for “gold” without taking risKS.

**Madara**: Gold, huuuh? I’m sure we need it to buy items or help your friends that are in a “State of Surrender”, right?

It’s 100 gold to help once. After that, the price increases with each game— gold is the lifeline of this “Battle on the Sugoroku Board.”

**Natsume**: YeS. Conversely, since we can revive each other quickly in the beginniNG, everyone should try to act aloNE. Even if someone’s attackED, the app can revive them right awAY.

**Arashi**: Understood. We’re on a rather tight schedule. I think it’d be good to compete on breaks.

I had just been to Maizuru Manor and was rubbed the wrong way by the children.

Let’s take our time and be careful…… And in the end, our NewDi Team will win♪

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/yd6m5bi2.png">

(Meanwhile. CosPro Team’s starting point)

**Ibara**: Gold is the lifeblood of this game, so in the beginning you have to collect gold while hiding—

—This is probably what the NewDi Team is probably thinking. With Natsume-kun as the leader, it seems unlikely that he’ll take any risks in the early stages.

Of course, we ‘re thinking the same thing. Unfortunately, our initial placement is bad.

Looking at the GPS information on the phone app, it seems that our CosPro Team has been placed near the center of the stage.

It seems best to first find a good hiding position and use that as our base.

**Yuuta**: ………

**Ibara**: Are you dissatisfied with something?

**Yuuta**: Uu~umm. I don’t want to be teamed up with Rinne-senpai.

We don’t usually mesh well together. TV-wise it’s better for us to be apart.

**Rinne**: C’mon don’t say that. I’ll make you realize my charm again through this “Battle on the Sugoroku Board.” Yuta’s eyes are about to turn into hearts☆

**Yuuta**: You never learn, do you… Why is my brother always like this?

**Ibara**: Hmm. It was a miscalculation that Yuuta, who’s not compatible with Rinne Amagi-shi, appeared on this show.

However, after witnessing the current back and forth, a different strategy has come to mind.

It’s called “zombie strategy.”

**Rinne**: “Zombie strategy?” What’s that?

**Ibara**: In this “Battle on the Sugoroku Board,” you can bring back teammates who are in a “State of Surrender” at any time by paying money through the app.

Teammates who are in a “State of Surrender” will have their gold and items confiscated— but if they have no money to begin with, there’s few disadvantages even if they die.

In other words, by consolidating the team’s gold with one person, you can quickly explore the surrounding area with low risk.

Fortunately, this app has a function to exchange items and gold—

I’ve asked Rinne Amagi-shi and Yuuta-kun, who’ve both left their gold with me and become penniless, to act independently.

I believe it makes sense to explore ahead of the other teams.

**Yuuta**: I see. Because you have us run errands with the premise of bringing us back to life, is that why it’s called “zombie strategy?”

**Ibara**: Yes. If you’re in a “State of Surrender,” I will release you at an appropriate time. If you obtain gold or items during the game, please hand them over to me.

Ultimately, it’ll create circumstances in which we gain the most strength— let’s make this the basic strategy of the CosPro Team.

**Rinne**: Understood. Then, let’s get started right away.

High risk! High risk, high reward is my go-to method☆

**Yuuta**: Ohh, he moves fast.

Well then, I’ll also start the strategy, vice prez.

**Ibara**: Heard. I’ll leave it to you, Yuuta-kun.

Ah. And one piece of advice.

Rinne Amagi-shi— that man stands out for better or for worse, so he’ll make for a good bullet shield. I recommend that you trail him from behind.

The weakness of “zombie strategy” is that the two teammates don’t have any weapons. I think it would be wise to temporarily retreat depending on the opponent’s strength.

**Yuuta**: As expected of a strategist. Does that mean you’re using the animosity between Rinne-senpai and I as part of your strategy?

Seeing Rinne-senpai getting beat up would bring me some relief—it’s not like I hate him that much though.

Well, it’s not bad. Since I went through the trouble to participate, I hope that it’ll help me relieve some stress.

Thank you for your advice. I’ll be heading off too.

**Ibara**: Alright. Go ahead and go all out.

Even if this is a variety show with lots of fun elements, I’m still a strategist. As a commander, let’s revel in it most of all♪

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/7mlzrydc.png">

(Location: “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” program set)

**Rinne**: Gyahahahahaha♪ Get outta my way, I’m heading through! The troublemaker of the idol industry, Rinne Amagi is passing through\~!

Anyone who’s got a problem with that, show yourselves to me! I have no intention of losing by leaving things up to chance!

Stop hiding and come on out! It’s much more fun to try your luck with dice than to stay hidden♪

**Yuuta**: (Uwah, he’s too easy to understand.

He said Rinne-senpai would be a good bullet shield, but I don’t think there’s many people who’d want to fight if he’s that brazen about it.

Since Rinne-senpai has a strong reputation for gambling, maybe people think he’s lucky?

There’s rumors that if he rolls the dice, he’ll definitely get a good result—

Honestly, though, that’s impossible.

In reality, at Starmony Dorms he often says “I lost big time\~!” and asks for food from those around him.

A person who makes gambler-like bets, with big stakes and big results.

It’s just the worst…… I absolutely don’t want to become like that.

…… And while I was thinking about that, he already ran so far away!

Now that he’s standing out like that, I have to follow behind.)

**Rinne**: ………

**Yuuta**: (Huh, he suddenly stopped?)

**Rinne**: I know you’re there, Yuta. It’s pretty obvious that you’re following me♪

**Yuuta**: Eh, when did you notice……!?

**Rinne**: Unfortunately for you, I have a good sense of intuition.

I lived in the countryside for a long time, so it’s like second nature to me. In a less populated place like this, you can hear everyone’s footsteps, y’know?

If you’re gonna follow me, you’re gonna have to stick with me. That would be more interesting♪

**Yuuta**: …… Don’t wanna.

Or rather, Rinne-senpai. Let me ask you, why are you walking around like you’re purposely trying to tell me where you are?

If you do that, you won’t be able to win the game

**Rinne**: Winning the game, huh\~? No, that’s just a bonus, right?

The key to success on a variety show is how interesting the footage is. Am I wrong?

**Yuuta**: …… Well, that is true, but…

Even if we lose the game, as long as we win overall, that’s fine. That kind of behavior is possible since 2wink’s done the same thing.

But that’s also behavior that gets criticized.

If you just want to make a living in the entertainment world, then maybe you should just play the role of a clown and keep your head down.

But, I’ve decided not to do too much of that kind of thing.

**Rinne**: Hmm……

You know what kind of life you’ll choose, Yuta.

That kind of idea isn’t bad either. So this time I’ll respect your ideas and fight a little more seriously♪

**Yuuta**: No, I don’t really care about that kind of thing. I’ll just do things my way.

By the way, there’s a building over there. And there’s someone there who isn’t an idol—

Are they maybe a cast member participating in “Battle on the Sugoroku Board?”

**Rinne**: Looks like it. It looks like a store with mysterious products lined up.

I don’t have a single bit of gold, but should we go? Even if it doesn’t help, it’ll still be good info to bring back to Hebi-chan.

**Yuuta**: Surely, if they sell support items, it’ll probably make the fight easier.

Let’s check it out for a moment. I don’t want to go all the way over there together, but it’s not a big enough deal that we have to split up.

**Rinne**: Gyahaha. Don’t be shy, Yuta~♪

**Yuuta**: I’m not being shy!

**Shopkeeper**: Welcome. Would you like to buy something?

**Yuuta**: Hmmhmm. “Reroll Card” is sold for 100G.

The “Substitute Doll”(1) that’s valid if you lose once costs 300G…… There’s quite a few support items.

**Rinne**: Check it out. In addition to game items, there’s also snacks and vending machines. It really feels like a store.

**Yuuta**: …… Don’t stick your hand under the vending machine while saying that kind of stuff. 

**Rinne**: I’ve heard that places like this are known for having coins just lying around.

We’re broke. If I just had some coins, we could buy all sorts of things—

Oh– there it is! A coin with 100G written on it!

**Yuuta**: That’s……

Well, should we buy a “Reroll Card” then? It’s not very strong, but it’d be good insurance if we had one—

**Rinne**: Puhaah, that soda really hit the spot\~♪

**Yuuta**: What are you doing?! You did *not* just buy juice with the money you picked up, did you!?

**Rinne**: My bad, my bad, are you thirsty? If you don’t mind sharing a drink with me, take it!

**Yuuta**: That’s not what I meant! You aren’t planning ahead at all!

Ahh, that precious 100G was used for juice……

I seriously don’t get it! Why would you do something so selfish, you idiot!

**Rinne**:  So, so shallow, Yuta! Don’t you know they say “you can’t fight on an empty stomach”?

Recording is a long process, so picking up supplies at the store will give you an advantage in the second half. —It makes sense♪

**Yuuta**: Why are you talking like a strategist!? Because you just ignored the strategy!?

Aaah, I guess I’m back to being broke again. Even though I’m at the store\~……

**Shopkeeper**: If you really want money, why don’t you ask to run an errand for me?

**Yuuta**: Eh?

**Shopkeeper**: The reward is 300G. I’d like you to deliver the products from that building over there to my house.

**Yuuta**: Let’s go let’s go! With 300G, we can buy a “Substitute Doll” and the vice prez’s strategy’ll go well……!

“We’ll” prove to you that we’re not as weak as we used to be. On behalf of Aniki.

(Meanwhile)

**Madara**: ……!

Oh. Looks like there’s an idol I haven’t seen before over there.

I’m roaring with laughter! I thought you were going to challenge me to a “Dice Battle”♪

So let’s recognize that sentiment! It’s time to get serious……☆

What a shaame. I rolled a 4. Would you like me to be an adult and help you with the rope?

Fufufu. Let me take all the money you have♪

**Arashi**: …… It looks like you’re having a lot of fun aren’t you, Mama?

**Madara**: Ohh. Arashi-san, so you were hiding in the shows like that, huuh.

Since you were heading in the opposite direction, I thought you’d gone far away.

**Arashi**: That was my plan, but I ended up coming back because I almost ran into kids from the other agencies.

After that, I got a little tired and took a short break. I’ve been very busy lately.

**Madara**: It’s no wonder. The children at Maizuru Manor took all your physical strength away from you, didn’t they?

**Arashi**: You’re right. It was cold so I felt like basking in the sun here. I take good care to protect my skin from UV rays, and I thought it’d be good to warm up a little.

It looks like they’re fighting quite a bit over there, aren’t they? We were told to move covertly, right?

**Madara**: Nooo. I have a big body, so I think I stand out quite a bit.

Fortunately, I’ve won three games in a row, so I’ve saved up quite a bit of gold. It would be an unexpected move.

**Arashi**: Hmm. In that case, wouldn’t it be okay if we met up with Natsume-chan once? I checked the GPS and it looks like we’re not too far apart.

How about we return with the gold and plan our next strategy?

**Madara**: That’s true. We might come up with an interesting strategy if we put our brains together.

How about it, Arashi-san? Do you want to come with me?

**Arashi**: I’ll pass. It’d be troublesome if I got caught up in a “Dice Battle” while on the move, so I decided to get a little more rest.

**Madara**: I see. Well, I’ll head back first. If Natsume-san has anything to say, I’ll let you know too.

Heave ho……☆

**Arashi**: Ehh!? Why’re you suddenly carrying me on your shoulders!?

**Madara**: Be quiet. I feel like there’s other people nearby.

If things continue like this, you might get caught up in a “Dice Battle.” I’ll take you to a safe spot.

**Rinne**: There’s no point in running away. I know you’re there♪

**Yuuta**: Mikejima-senpai! Won’t you let us apprehend you?

**Madara**: Hmm. I’ve been caught.

(But, it was a good thing that Arashi-san was able to escape into the shadows. Two on two, crushing each other, it’s just not worth it.

Run away while I fight, Arashi-san.)

**Arashi**: (Understood. I’ll keep my distance, so I’ll have to ask you to take care of the rest.)

**Madara**: It’s a pain, and I don’t really want to fight you guys— but it can’t be helped. I’ll treat myself to a “Dice Battle.”

Who will go first? I don’t care who my opponent is.

**Rinne**: Sorry Yuta, but I’ll take the lead. You came all this way to play, so it’d be a waste if you didn’t have fun♪

C’mon let’s raise the stakes!It’s a match to see if it’ll roll even or odd!

**Madara**: “Dice Battle” isn’t chō-han,(1) but oh well.

I’m also fired up for the most carefree job I’ve had in a long time—so I’ll give it my all.

**Rinne**: I got a 5! Lucky, I’ve got luck from the get go!

**Madara**: I rolled… a 2, huh.

**Rinne**: Gyahaha! I’m the winner! You’re going to obediently be tied up, Mikeneko-chan♪ 

**Madara**: Ah ah. Did you think I didn’t have the item?

“Reroll Card”—I’ll use this support item to get another roll!

Sorry, but I just happened to have fought an opponent who had a “Reroll Card.” Don’t let anyone tell you the game was won here.

**Rinne**: Heeh, you’re being a bad loser……♪ But things are starting to get interesting♪

My dice is 5. In other words, if you don’t roll a 5 or higher, you’re wasting your time, aren’t you? Do you understand that?

**Madara**: Of course. Compared to the complexity of events in reality, having a one in three chance is almost a luxury.

…… So, let me try again. I rolled a— 6!

Unfortunately for you, it seems the goddess of fate is smiling on me, isn’t she?

**Rinne**: Hmm, way to go♪

But even if I don’t make it, a second and third me will appear! Your reign won’t last—

Isn’t that right, Yuta? You’ll avenge me, right?

**Yuuta**: Eh. I don’t like it in general, but…

I mean, please don’t make me your copy without my permission.

The only rule is that when you encounter an enemy, a “Dice Battle” will automatically start, so I’m not going to try and avenge you or anything.

I’ll only fight according to the rules. Are you ready, Mikejima-senpai?

**Madara**: Yeah, come at me from wherever you are!

I’ll also go at it without hesitation. If this is a showdown-type variety show, no matter how hard you try, you’ll just be cute villain……☆

(Location: Cage)

**Rinne**: He~y, it’s the newcomer Rinne Amagi! Nice to meet ya!

………

It’s the newcomer Rinne Amagi! Nice to meet ya!

**Madara**: No response, huh? Apparently we’re not welcome.

**Rinne**: Oioi. We’re co-stars aren’t we? You don’t have to be so rude, y’know.

Don’t be silent and say something. If you keep looking down in the dumps, you won’t make it into a variety show. Is everyone depressed from getting out early?

**Madara**: Actually, it’s a program that would be better off if we left.

I was also killed instantly, so Rinne-san and I were taken away together. Honestly, if you don’t have items, it’s just a game of luck.

It’s the best part of “fun to fight, interesting to lose.”

Although, they don’t seem to be glaring at us because they lost the “Dice Battle.”

This is hypothetical, but. These idols are from non-ES agencies— non-ES idols may be wary of us ES idols.

I’m sure a small agency that’s appearing on an unknown internet program would be especially sensitive about that kind of thing, wouldn’t they?

“Are you going to expand into online programming and steal our jobs!?” …… It’s no surprise that some people are angry.

Well, we’re reaping what we sowed.

Not all humans are equal, but the world cleverly proclaims that “all humans are equal.”

There are even people who believe this, and avoid seeing the inconvenient truth.

However, it was the ES side who drew them into a huge trend and overran the existing industry. There’ll naturally be some backlash.

If they want to keep their distance, there’s no need to force our way in.

**Rinne**: You’re cold. In the entertainment world, that’s true.

Mikeneko-chan and I are “strays” within ES. If we all work together to liven up this boring show, we’ll be able to raise the stocks.

**Madara**: No, I’m a pretty smart guy. Wouldn’t it seem strange if someone thought I was close to NewDi’s management?

**Rinne**: Eh, is that so?

**Madara**: Yes. Otherwise, they wouldn’t want to accept something as suspicious as Double Face.

It’s a unit that’s like a powder keg– you never know when it might explode if it gets hit.

Since we’re in that kind of a situation, I’d like to go on friendly terms.

It’s not so easy to do all this.

**Rinne**: It’s a daily routine.

**Madara**: That’s what you say.

In any case, there’s nothing to do in the cage. Let’s have a chat and enjoy this casual atmosphere♪

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/n9txnkih.png">

(Location: “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” program set)

(CosPro Team’s Amagi and Mikejima of NewDi Team have surrendered.)

**Ibara**: (…… Hmm. It seems Rinne Amagi-shi and Mikejima-shi had an encounter and entered the cage.

Seeing as Yuuta-kun, who was in the same position on the GPS, is still alive, it seems he won against Mikejima-shi and ended things with both sides suffering damage.

The CosPro Team benefited from not allowing anyone but myself to hold the gold.

Unless our opponent is also using the zombie strategy, the difference will be felt in the final stages.

The problem is, when will Rinne Amagi-shi be revived? It seems like it’d be a good idea to leave him alone for now.

He appears to be able to get along well with the other participants— idols from small agencies.

The more time he can buy, the more time I’ll have to do my own research.

Especially in regards to the unknown idols booked by small agencies— I’m curious about how they were chosen.

Many of the promising candidates working at weaker agencies have transferred to ES agencies.

Idols who stayed at the small agencies don’t have impressive achievements.

If I understand the intentions in hiring them, the intentions of the program should become clear as well.

What was the production director, who once committed violent acts, thinking in calling them to be on “Battle on the Sugoroku Board?”

And what was NETV’s intention in hiring such a person?

If I understand this, then I should be able to understand whether NETV is a promising investment target.

When you’re investing a large amount of money, you need to have a good chance of winning.

As a strategist, my main focus is not on winning or losing the game, but rather on that—

At most, I’ll watch over you until the end, management of NETV……☆)

(Meanwhile)

(CosPro Team’s Amagi and NewDi Team’s Mikejima have surrendered.)

**Natsume**: …… HmM. Looks like Mikejima-senpai has been defeaTED.

He’s the weakest member of the NewDi Team…… I don’t mean to sound clicHÉ, but it’s not something to panic aboUT.

What bothers me is that they both went into the “State of Surrender” at the same tiME.

It’s only natural to think that Rinne-senpai and someone from CosPro Team were togethER, but they seem to prefer to act alONE.

Either a third party gained the fisherman’s profIT (1), or, against our expectations, Yuuta-kun and Ibara-kun were accompanying hIM— 

RegardlESS, as the leader I’m having trouble thinking of when to bring back Mikejima-senpAI.

…… HM? GPS information has been updatED?

Kaminari-san is approaching ME?

**Arashi**: Ahh I found you! So you were hiding in a place like this, Natsume-chan.

But why are you climbing the roof? I wouldn’t have known where you were without GPS.

**Natsume**: I can’t afford to cut corners when it comes to winnING. The golden rule of ground warfare is to secure a viEW.

**Arashi**: Ufufu. Natsume-chan doesn’t like to lose either.

Then, let me walk through the building and get there too……

It looks like Mama’s in the “State of Surrender,” so what should I do? You can revive him by paying money, right?

**Natsume**: HmM. As I said befoRE, the first time will cost 100G, and from there it’ll double as the game progressES.

In other worDS, if I spend too much, then I’ll end up with an amount that can’t revive anyone at the end of the gaME.

Aren’t there many teams anticipating this and also making the decision to not reviVE?

I’m a bit puzzled over whether Mikejima-senpai’s abilities are irreplacaBLE.

(…… Even sO, I hate losING.

I have no intentions of losing “Battle on the Suogoroku BoaRD.”

It could just be that I hate losING, but by winning, I can get closer to the production director and management of NETV.

It may be cut from the broadcaST, but it’ll remain in the recordiNG. If I want them to come cleAN, that’s where I have to question thEM.

As a condition for my appearanCE, I was allowed to bring in a few film crew members who are close to us at NewDI. I’d like to hear their answers through the recordING.)

………

**Arashi**: Natsume-chan?

**Natsume**: I thought about it for a whiLE…… The question of whether or not to revive Mikejima-senpAI.

Considering that it’ll be an all-out war at the eND, wouldn’t it be appropriate to leave this aloNE?

Let’s save up some gold for a whiLE. It’s better to let Mikejima-senpai go on a rampage latER.

Let’s let the beast rest in the cage for a whiLE♪

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/14gvtjr3.png">

(Location: Cage)

**Madara**: Help’s not coming, huhh? And yet our fellow prisoners are watching our every move…… It’s exactly like a bed of needles.

**Rinne**: Even though we’re the ones trapped in a cage, they’re lazing around. …… I guess they didn’t notice that we were caught?

**Madara**: No, since it was announced on set, I guess they’re not bringing us back on purpose.

I wonder if my leader’s thinking “In the end, it’s going to be an all out war so we’ll just let other agencies compete with each other for now.”

That seems like something he’d think.

**Rinne**: Looks like we were thinking the same thing…… I think Mikeneko-chan and I are similar even if we’re in different positions.

**Madara**: But, compared to Maizuru Manor, this is a lot more easy going, isn’t it? You don’t have to try to pacify others to make them like you, and it’s okay for them to hate you as much as they’d like.

**Rinne**: “Maizuru Manor?” What’s that? Did you get banned from a hotel or somethin’?

**Madara**: Haha. It has nothing to do with you.

More importantly, let’s have a fun little chat♪ We won’t gain anything from staring at each other, right?

…… It’s difficult to say if there’s anything particularly worth talking about. I know, how about talking about Rinne-san and I’s experiences?

Double Face, Crazy:B, and MaM…… None of these units are straightforward, and I think they’re worth hearing about.

**Rinne**: Oh, then let’s talk about our funny friend, hm? I’d like to hear about how you see Kohaku-chan.

Help isn’t coming anyway. Let’s have a chat♪

**Madara**: Let’s. As long as the cameras are rolling, we can’t talk carelessly. It’s convenient if we talk about that.

For example…… How about the story from when Kohaku wore a suit for Double Face work?

It was funny seeing him struggle to tie his necktie, don’t you think?

**Rinne**: Great! I looove stories like that♪

Then I’ll also tell you an anecdote that won’t disappoint!

You guys should join the sharing circle too. It’s boring just watching silently, isn’t it♪

(Location: “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” program set)

**Natsume**: …… It looks like the person over there is a staff membER.

**Arashi**: Hmm. They’re wearing some strange clothes. It looks like they’re wearing a team vest that matches the color of the set.

**Natsume**: They’re probably an NPC from “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” I thiNK. It seems they didn’t have enough budget to make costumes for the staFF.

Maybe I can ask them for a mission to get goLD. Let’s talk to them.

**Staff**: Ahh, you’re just in time! Could you take this box to the store over there?

I was planning to deliver the goods myself, but I got injured— As thanks, I’ll give you all the money I have. It’s important to be confident that the goods will be delivered properly!

**Natsume**: …… HmM. The mission details also seem like they’re based on the gaME.

It’s just called “Open World SugoroKU.”

It’s likely that, in the early stages, some teams will adopt a hiding strategy and actively stockpile gold and iteMS.

**Arashi**: The set’s announcements were also sounding off a lot. I think we’re being too passive.

**Natsume**: It depends on how you look at iT. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there’s a risk of moving too muCH.

I think the reckless actors were wiped out in the early stagES, but from here on we should also be proactiVE.

First, there’s the transporting to the store missiON. If we try to go the shortest rouTE, we’ll end up walking through the middle of an open roAD, increasing the risk of contact with the eneMY.

It takes longer to move forward while hiding in the shadoWS, but our end-game item loadout could overwhelm the enemy teAM.

I’m not sure which is the best solutiON.

**Arashi**: That’s how it is, isn’t it. We don’t have any support items, we’re too defenseless.

I wonder if our leader Natsume-chan will take the initiative and be an example♪

**Natsume**: Shouldn’t the track and fielder run theRE?

**Arashi**: Nope. I’m not that serious about track and field, you know?

I think a member of the game research club like Natsume-chan is better at perceiving space, so you should go. Go on, go on♪

**Natsume**: Don’t poke mE. It’s irritatiNG.

…… It’s no use trying to impose roles on each othER. I get it, this time I’ll walk in froNT.

InsteaD, please revive me as soon as I’m in the “State of SurrendER.” We have to avoid total annihilatiON.

**Arashi**: Gotcha. Leave the rest to me♪

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/lulmrhh7.png">

**Yuuta**: Ah, there he is. Vice prez, what are you doing?

**Ibara**: Your voice is too loud, Yuuta-kun. Please be quiet.

Also, I was just doing some research at the moment, so could you please lower your voice?

**Yuuta**: You’re researching? Why now?

**Ibara**: Ah, now that I think about it, I didn’t tell you.

The production director of “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” had previously been in trouble with the police for assaulting entertainers.

**Yuuta**: Ehh, that’s unexpected~. Vice prez, you absolutely wouldn’t appear on a program like that, right?

**Ibara**: That was my intention, but I have a connection with NETV so I couldn’t just sit back and watch.

I took the opportunity of appearing on the show to learn more about the production director’s background.

If I use the phone provided by the program, my behavior may be monitored, so I’m using my own phone.

I’m currently asking the staff that accompanied us to record the program to report on the director’s movements.

**Yuuta**: Uwah, that’s against the rules.

But it doesn’t look like they’re doing anything publicly, huh? I don’t think they’re going to do anything bad if they’re being watched.

**Ibara**: Indeed. There haven’t been any strange movements so far.

However, it’s always a good idea to stay vigilant. There’s no guarantee that the performers won’t do something during the game under the instructions of the director.

……!? Yuuta-kun, wait.

**Yuuta**: Uwah, why’re you patting my head!?

**Ibara**: Wrong. Please lie down.

**Yuuta**: ?

**Ibara**: Look, you can see it too. There’s a bunch of idols nearby.

I don’t know what their purpose is, but we can see them.

GPS information is only supposed to be known by team members— someone might be leaking the information,

…… I thought it was strange.

Before the recording, I went to greet the idols from other agencies, but they acted hostile towards ES idols.

They may have taken advantage of the director’s weaknesses and made it so that they would win the game.

**Yuuta**: Ehh, that kind of thing can happen?

**Ibara**: It’s merely a hypothetical. We should always assume the worst case scenario, though.

We have to bring back Rinne Amagi-shi right away to avoid our team being wiped out.

Let’s use our head and get through this situation. Alright, Yuuta-kun?

**Yuuta**: Understood! If I’m going to play, I want to win……!

(Location: Cage)

(A few minutes before— The “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” set’s cage)

**Rinne**: —And that’s when I found out that Kohaku-chan’s scared of ghosts.

Oh! You won’t tell him, right? He seems to be pretty conscious of it♪

**Madara**: Oh. I’ve heard good things about that♪

I want to take Kohaku-san to a haunted house next time and see his reaction. I’m serious about it.

**Rinne**: No, completely ignore it.

Well, it’s not something to hide and I don’t care what you say.

More importantly, I’m curious about whether you guys’ll continue with Double Face. He’s got his schedule set aside for Crazy:B, doesn’t he?

**Madara**: Haha. What’re you talking about, Rinne-san? Isn’t that Kohaku’s main job?

I’m a two-timer with MaM too. It’s nice to be able to use it for convenience, like a relative’s house that you go to sometimes.

**Rinne**: I don’t mind either way. I’m sure Kohaku-chan wants to do it too.

**Madara**: More importantly, it looks like other idols are listening in, aren’t they?

I don’t know how it looks from the outside, but ES isn’t rock solid either. How about I talk to you like someone who knows inside info?

You’re good at getting the audience excited in your lives, right?

**Rinne**: Lives and chats are two different things. I’m not really a gossip, y’kno~w?

**Madara**: Despite what you’re saying, you look like you can’t help but want to chat♪

**Rinne**: Gyahaha, that’s true!

I’ve also been forced to suffer a lot. I feel sorry for all the cute kids that couldn’t fit into the industry!

If you have something to say, say it♪ We’re in a cage anyway, no one will hear you.

**Idol**: There’s nothing to talk about with a blessed ES idol……

**Rinne**: Oi oi. You’re too naive. It’s true that we’re in a pretty lofty position, but up until recently I was on the verge of being fired, y’know.

But lucky for me, I won the bet. I risked my life on a big gamble and just barely hit the mark.

If I say that, people might get angry because it means the future’s uncertain. “Don’t lecture me” and “You don’t have to tell me” and all that.

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/gn5n7o5h.png">

**Rinne**: But I can tell you this. The goddess of fate won’t smile on those who curse their own fate♪

I’m an idol, just like all of you. So don’t be so cold.

Let me hear your stories.

**Idol**: ………

…… The reason we appeared on “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” was because it’s what the agency wanted.

Since I’m in a small agency, I had no choice but to obey.

The program’s intentionally trying to make the ES idols lose.

It looks like they gave support items to some idols in advance, and it can turn any situation upside-down.

**Rinne**: Haah? Does that mean this program’s rigged?

**Madara**: An interesting story. In other words, you guys are assassins who showed up to outwit us.

However, you’re a pretty “cute” assassin. I guess you have no intention of taking my life.

What’s your purpose, then?

Even if you beat us, since it’s not a pure performance-based contest, there won’t be much benefit to it, right?

**Rinne**: No, I don’t know about that.

ES is a big deal to these guys.

They want to win, even if just once, and to get rid of their frustrations— those are also motivating factors.

**Madara**: So what’s really going on? The sooner you talk, the easier it’ll be.

The circumstances of adults aren’t that satisfactory anyways.

**Idol**: We don’t know why the agency came up with a plan like that……

All I heard from the agency was “We want you to appear on a NETV program in order to eliminate the disparities in the entertainment industry.”

I even wonder sometimes what the point of doing something like this is. But the director, who didn’t like the way ES was running things, was also on board with it……

Honestly, we didn’t expect ES idols to be so friendly.

Sorry for acting the way I did.

**Madara**: Hmm. So you guys are at the bottom and don’t understand what the agency or director are thinking.

Then, it seems we have no choice but to ask the production director.

**Rinne**: Wait. That kind of thing—

How about we flip that scenario on its head?

**Madara**: Yeah…… Personally, I’d like to understand the other party’s plans and destroy them. I honestly don’t care whether we win or lose the program.

…… But it’s annoying to fall into our opponent’s trap, isn’t it?

Alright. Well, I’ll be happy to help ya out♪

CosPro and NewDi are probably similar in that their leaders hate losing.

I think they’d hate it, but how about we form a united front?

I’m sure that’ll make the program more exciting♪

**Rinne**: Heeh, that’s fine. A united front♪

It’s hard to be trusted easily though. We’re a team with poisonous bees and poisonous snakes. You never know when we’re going to poison you, right?

**Madara**: Hahaha, I can’t speak for others, but I’m used to not being trusted.

Even as we proclaim our own justice, we transcend barriers and fight together for the same purpose— that’s also heroic, and I like it♪

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/2llojktn.png">

(Location: “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” program set)

(Going back in time. “Battle on the Sugoroku Board”—CosPro Team’s hiding place)

**Ibara**: For the time being, it would be good to use the app to bring back Rinne Amagi-shi, however— we’re weakened.

An unexpected surprise attack…… And then, as if they all know each other, they’re encircling the surrounding area without engaging the enemy.

Ahaha! At this rate, we’ll both be crushed by the human wave strategy♪

**Yuuta**: This isn’t the time to be laughing\~!?

If this continues, we’ll be in a desperate situation. What should we do?

No, it’s fine if we’re in a desperate situation, but I don’t want to owe Rinne-senpai……! I’m sure we’ll end up in a troublesome relationship!

**Ibara**: How much do you hate him?

However, if it looks like you’re defeated here, it’ll affect your dignity.

Even if they’ve surrounded us, it’s just a game. “I” won’t be fooled by such tactics.

Encircling the surrounding area to prevent enemy contact means there are many gaps to escape through—

Yuuta-kun, please lend me your phone.

**Yuuta**: Ah, sure. Understood.

**Ibara**: Then, I’d be oh so grateful if I could use i—t!

**Yuuta**: YOU THREW IIIIIIIIT!?

That’s the phone I borrowed for the show!? Is it fine to do that!?

**Ibara**: Well, if I’m asked to make amends then I’ll handle it.

Take a look at that, Yuuta-kun. Idols from the other teams are flocking to your phone.

In other words, the enemy didn’t know where we were, but were instead relying on GPS signals to locate our surroundings—

I’ll temporarily turn off my phone, so let’s leave this place immediately.

**Yuuta**: Ah, I see. GPS—

So they took advantage of the fact that our location was leaked!

**Ibara**: Indeed. Let’s run away while we still can, Yuuta-kun.

**Yuuta**: Then, let’s use the shadow of the building to go around the other side! I’m sure we can escape safely while they’re distracted by my phone……☆

…… We’re fine now that we’re this far, aren’t we?

**Ibara**: Yes, probably—

**Yuuta**: Even so, we were in trouble, huh… I can’t believe our GPS location was leaked……

I don’t know why we were the only ones targeted though?

Is it because we’re too strong? But, a “Dice Battle” only begins when we come face to face. Mechanically, it’s difficult for teams to cooperate with each other, isn’t it?

**Ibara**: The thing is, it was probably that the program side “staged” for them to do it.

**Yuuta**: …… EH!?

“Battle on the Sugoroku Board” is a pretty serious competition program, isn’t it? Is that even possible?

**Ibara**: Well, if we asked about it, the production side will probably insist that it’s “staged for effect.”

However, the program’s supposed to be aired as a serious competition from the comfort of your own home. Otherwise, viewers will be disappointed.

Therefore, the program probably created a situation made to look “staged,” but it wasn’t. 

For example, preparing support items that can leak the enemy’s GPS.

**Yuuta**: Ah, that explains it.

The vice prez’s quick thinking helped us out a lot. Throwing my phone to create an illusion of where we are. You really are a strategist, huh?

**Ibara**: It gives me mixed feelings to hear someone call me a “strategist” to my face.

Luckily, Yuuta-kun’s phone didn’t have any gold in it, so I figured it’d be fine to throw it away.

According to the rules, if you encounter an enemy without your phone , you won’t be able to start a “Dice Battle” and will instead automatically enter the “State of Surrender.”

If we had left the problem as it was, we could have been defeated.

We’re going to collect your phone later, so we have to start moving now.

Let’s exchange our gold for support items to improve our fighting strength. Yuuta-kun, do you know of any shops that sell items?

**Yuuta**: Yes, I found one while walking with Rinne-senpai.

An item that allows you to reroll your dice— the “Reroll Card” was sold for 100G. There was also something called the “Substitute Doll” that was sold for 300G.

**Ibara**: Then let’s head over there. Fortunately, I only used 100G to revive Rinne Amagi-shi, so I think I’ll be able to buy items as well.

We shall prepare armaments for the upcoming decisive battle. That’s fine, isn’t it?

**Rinne**: ♪\~

Aah, it’s been a while since I’ve breathed in the air of the free world. How delicious ♪

…… Not really, I was still able to breathe in the outside air, though. I was surprised cause I wasn’t expecting to go into the cage is aaall?

I’ll have the privilege of being a free man for the time being ♪

(Ooh? Those guys are–)

**Natsume and Arashi**: ………!

**Rinne**: (It’s the NewDi Team. I wonder if the “Dice Battle” isn’t being triggered because they’re far enough away from me.

Since I’m the only one who’s noticed, why don’t I do a little spying on the enemy’s situation. Now let’s see…?)

**Arashi**: We couldn’t get much at all huh. They said the reward was 100G.

Even though I’ve accepted about three requests from a while ago, isn’t crossing a dangerous bridge for 100G or 200G not worth it?

It’s good that we can immediately buy support items with the rewards because the shop’s commissions are around the area, but…… They’re all backbreaking work.

**Natsume**: I thiNK it’s good that we can even get that much.  BecauSE at the very leasT, we can revive Mikejima-senpai if we have 100G.

**Arashi**: That’s true. It’s about time to get Mama out of the cage isn’t it?

Natsume-chan. I wonder if I can ask to pay with the smartphone?

**Natsume**: Oh nO. I feel likE it’s still a little too early.

MayBE it’s because each team is currently crushing each other, but there it seEMS like there aren’t many signs of people around uS. What aboUT reviving him in a situation whEN we have an encounter with someone?

We’re talking about Mikejima-senpai after aLL. The situation in the game couLD change as soon as he gets revived.

More importantLY. While the war situation right now is calm, let’s go look for the next commission—

**Arashi**: I’d like you to wait a bit.

**Natsume**: UmM?

Could it bE you want to rescue Mikejima-senpai sooner or somethING?

**Arashi**: No, that’s not it.

Look closely, Natsume-chan. Look over there— isn’t that an enemy team’s idol?

And it’s not just that one person, there are several of them…… Lying in wait.

**Natsume**: HmM. It lookS like there are about 10 people.

Which meANS that the members of three or more teams are conspiring and lyiNG in wait for us……

We caN’T take it too easy. We haVE to get through somehow.

**Arashi**: Get through…….?

**Natsume**: Kaminari-san, I haVE an idea.

If anything, let’S takE advantage of this situation. Can’t we use support items to wipe them out wholesale, hM?

**Arashi**: It certainly seems worth a try. I wanted to try out that item too.

I wonder if the cheap rewards for the commissions had a meaning to some extent ♪
image

**Rinne**: (…… Heeh. As expected, those guys are being prowled after for being grouped together with ES, huh.

I guess it’s about time to contact the CosPro Team huh~? With the way things are now, there’s no guarantee that we won’t fall for their trap too.

Firstly, to support the ES forces, preventing the idols from other agencies from attacking us carelessly—

After that, we’ll sniff out the mastermind’s calculations and crush those calculations!

It’s the best strategy! As one would expect, the Goddess of Victory is smiling upon me!

Let’s quickly check the GPS location of my teammates—-There.

What’s this? Yuta’s GPS is moving rapidly……?

Oi oi, are you riding the Shinkansen (1) or something! That’s so funny!

Is it that? When you’re underground and the GPS information is delayed or something?

Anyway, I know where you’re at. I’ll be there soon, so wait for me ♪ )

**Tsumugi**: It’s a bit of a confusing free-for-all, huh\~. It’s fun to watch.

Thank you to all the Staff-san, for letting me observe something so interesting.

I can switch between monitors to watch footage from the filming set, but from here I can see everything from a bird’s eye view. It’s somewhat refreshing.

I tend to be the one being filmed…… I don’t really get to watch variety shows from the outside like this.

Two teams have been eliminated, while there are 10 or so idols trapped in the cage— considering there were about 30 participants, it’s been quite a progression.

I really want the NewDi Team to hang in there. Even if it’s not winning first place, riding the flow like this is exciting—-

It’s similar to watching amateur sports tournaments. The main goal is to win, but winning is not everything.

As a supporter from the sidelines, I want Natsume-kun and the team to keep surviving.

Ah. By the way, can you show me NewDi Team’s footage? I got curious since there’s mostly been other teams’ footage for a while…….

**Staff**: Sorry, Aoba-san. Right now, the staff are together with other teams, so ask again later.

**Tsumugi**: Ah, then it’s okay. I’ll be counting on you later.

(Hm\~m……? They haven’t been filming them for a while, huh. Despite that, I can’t see any movements from the footage being streamed.

There should be filming crews following both NewDi Team and CosPro Team, but I don’t see any footage being streamed at all.

Somehow, it feels like they’re avoiding them……?

That said, I’m thinking too much. It’s just that the timing coincidentally didn’t line up—-

Everyone is doing their work seriously. Even I can see that.)

**Arashi**: Use this app…… Is this ok?

**Natsume**: YeP. It looks like the item is actually being useD. Let’s gO, then.

**Natsume and Arashi**: 3, 2, 1— GO!

**Idol**: They split into two! Defeat them both!

**Arashi**: Ufufu, even if I’m from the track and field club, I can’t avoid a “Dice Battle” that’ll start as soon as I encounter someone.

Still, it’s a shame……♪

**Idol A**: A “Dice Battle” isn’t being triggered……!?

**Arashi**: We used a support item. When using the “Disappearing Mantle” (1) — this item prevents the person using this item from joining a “Dice Battle”. 

There’s the disadvantage where you would not be able to proceed with a battle on your own, but it’s useful for when you’re in a situation surrounded by enemies.

For example, you can make your enemies fight each other just like this……☆

**Idol B**: Oi, you……

**Idol A**: Wha……! You guys were the ones who said to ambush them!

**Idol B**: You’re the one who said to “Run down the NewDi Team”. Don’t make this our fault!

**Natsume**: Oh my mY. A falling out between friends is unsightly, you knOW?

FuFU, it seeMS like you guys wanted to ambush the NewDi Team, but the opposite thing happenED.

In this “Battle on the Sugoroku Board”, the momeNT you come into contact with the enemy team’s idol, a “Dice Battle” wiLL be triggered.

HowevER, the range of the “enemy contact” is a tricky thiNG. The “Dice Battle” would nOT trigger unless you’re within a certain distance. Which means, you can’NT defeat an enemy by just observing.

That’s why I took advantaGE of that rule, setting fiRE to all the ambushing idols on the other side all at once. (2)

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/fj2uez35.png">

**Natsume**: “It seEMS that I wasn’t able to join the “Dice Battle” though — Everyone is in a marriage interview, but is it fiNe if you let me slip away?”(3) ……Or something like thaT.

And then a “Dice Battle” outbreak will occUR between the multiple enemy teams gathered here.

It truly is a wholesale arrest. (4) Sorry about this, but I’m makING everyone sustain huge damages…….♪

**Idol C**: Shit, is there no way to avoid a “Dice Battle” with this many people!?

**Idol D**: How many teams are here……!

**Natsume**: Come aloNG, now iS the time to run, Kaminari-san.

**Arashi**: Yes. While the support item’s time limit isn’t reached. Watching the infighting between them is fun in its own way, but it’s not the time to get carried away watching right?

Among everyone involved in this “Dice Battle”outbreak, only one person would come out with a large amount of gold and items.

We can’t afford to not run from such a dangerous person, see?

Bye, everyone. Let’s meet again sometime ♪

But that’s only if you can safely survive……☆

Ufufu, somehow I feel refreshed♪

Ah, it’s fun when your strategy goes well, right? A great achievement, leader.

**Natsume**: WeLL, I’m not just putting on appearances of having gotten to know games, you knOW. I’m usEd to abusing rules like these.

……More importantLY, you saw didn’t yOU? Mikejima-senpai.

**Madara**: Yeah. I found you immediately since you were ‘lighting the fire’ so loudlyyy.

By purposely revealing your whereabouts, you managed to get even more people to get caught up in the “Dice Battle.” Thanks to that, all I could do was to look on from a distance from the surrounding area thoough?

**Natsume**: That’s my bAD.

Right now people who approach us are forced to engaGE in battle with other teams. We’ve usED a valuable item, so we haVE to make use of it thoroughly. 

**Arashi**: However, it seems that thanks to that, people from other teams won’t be able to get their hands on us as easily.

Mama’s back too, so now the NewDi Team is complete.

**Madara**: Ah, about that. On the way back here, I earned a little reward. If you’d like, please use it.

**Natsume**: HmM, 300G……That’s quiTE a lot of money. That’LL be of help.
image

**Madara**: Also, I have something to tell Natsume-san.

**Natsume**: Hm?

**Madara**: It’s about that. Idols from weaker agencies are colluding to defeat the NewDi Team. 

They’ve been told to make it look like we ES idols are defeated. On the show program’s side, it seems that they’re painting the scene for us ES idols to lose.

To put simply, it’s “staged.”

**Natsume**: “Staged”……?

**Madara**: Yeah. I don’t really know why, but we’ve made ourselves enemieess. It looks like the agencies have been egging them on.

It seems among them, there are idols who have been given items by the management and are complicit with the “staging”.

**Natsume**: I sEE. I had an inkling of thiS, but the “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” staff were pulling the strings behind the scenes, huH.

But this iS baffling. Letting us win shoulD garner more rising popularity— I don’t seE any merit in purposely letting idols from other agencies win.

The hard-to-know-what-he’s-thinking-aboUT “NETV” program director who had caused a violent incident in the paST. As well as the idoLS from weaker agencies gathered here……

It feeLS like there has to be a reason they are all coincidentally gathered here. This isn’t a chance arrangemeNT, so there shouLD be several clues to find.

………

Could it bE— it might be possiblE to understand their intentions.

**Madara**: Oh……

**Arashi**: Can you tell us in more detail?

**Natsume**: MmM. However there’s noT much time. I’ll explain as we keep on the moVE.

EveryoNE, I’m going to be developing a certain strategy from now on, so could you lend me your cooperatioN?

I’m going to buy “Disappearing Mantle” one morE time. If I don’t do thAT, there are things that can’t be done, you sEE.♪

(After a short while.)

**Rinne**: GYAAAAAAAA! DIE DIE!

My roll is “2”…….. This is risky!

Come on “1”! “1”!

UuOOOOo! There it is, the “1”! It’s my close win!

Haa, I’ve completely used up all my luck after winning three consecutive times~ I mean, why’s Yuta’s smartphone’s left behind at a place like this?

I was certain that he’d be here but when I came, I fell into a trap.

If it wasn’t this me who is loved by the goddess of competition, I’d have ended up going back to the cage again at this point.

Now then, that’s enough of being against my expectations. Let’s use the GPS one more…… oh?

**Ibara**: There’s no need for that. Rinne Amagi-shi.

Me and Yuuta-kun are both just looking to see if we could get that smartphone back.

**Rinne**: Oh, were ya’ hidin’ somewhere?

Here you are. You’ve dropped your smartphone y’see?

A kind Onii\~san picked it up for you. He’ll be happy if you have a word of thanks or two♪

**Yuuta**: Hmph.

**Rinne**: Oi oi, he just snatched away the smartphone…… Are you a wild animal?

**Yuuta**: Don’t get too familiar. You’re not my Aniki.

Or rather, you just picked it up on your own, so can you not act so self important?

**Rinne**: Don’t say something so cold~ Hina isn’t here today. It’s okay for you to think of me as an older brother and spoil me♪

**Yuuta**: ? Did you say something just now?

**Rinne**: I’m blatantly being ignored, huh……But that’s the cute part!

**Ibara**: Ahem (clears throat). The both of you, keep your messing around to that area and keep yourselves hidden. I need to plan my next strategy.

Did you hear the on-set announcement a short while ago? A number of idols have dropped out.

Now that they’re in the ‘State of Surrender’, there should not be more than 10 survivors.

Which means that the “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” is at its climax— a strategy towards the final phase has become necessary.

Though I can’t say that I’ve stockpiled much gold or items so far.

Fortunately, due to Rinne Amagi-shi defeating three enemy players, we have a little leeway.

Let’s eradicate the remaining enemies using these equipment.

About the allocation of gold and items—

**Natsume**: CaN you include us in that discussion?

**Ibara**: Whoa……. Natsume-kun, why are you here?

**Madara**: Me and Arashi-san are here tooo♪ The NewDi Team’s come all together to see you.

**Rinne**: But why is a “Dice Battle” not happening? You guys are an enemy team aren’t ya?

**Arashi**: Ufufu. This is an item’s effect. When you use “Disappearing Mantle”, you can prevent a “Dice Battle” from happening for a while ♪

**Rinne**: “Disappearing Mantle”? That sorta stuff exist?

**Yuuta**: It was available at the store. We didn’t have any money at all at the time so we couldn’t buy it…….

But why did you go through the trouble of coming to see us? CosPro Team and NewDi team are mutual enemies competing for the overall victory, right?

It’s hard to imagine you coming to see how we’re doing when there is no merit in doing so.

**Arashi**: That’s because we’ve come to negotiate with the CosPro Team.

**Ibara**: Negotiate?

**Natsume**: YeAH. I don’t know if you’ve noticed this as well, bUT us ES idols have been led into a tight contest bY someone.

Multiple teams encircled us to force us to drop out toO—

It seems that while he was iN the cage, Mikejima-senpai heard about the inner workings frOM other agencies’ idols.

The production team of “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” are tryinG to make the ES idols lose by  “staging.”

**Ibara**: Hmm. So something like that is being talked about.

Rinne Amagi-shi, you were in the cage too. Did you know about those inner workings?

**Rinne**: Ah, it did have a peep in my ears. Just a little late in reporting about it.

Those people can’t help but resent ES idols, so at first they intended to defeat us and followed the outline laid out for them.

Listening to their story is a testament to my personal virtue! When I told them about how I’m being treated coldly by the agency, they opened up their hearts to me~♪

**Yuuta**: I feel like that’s just you reaping what you’ve sown.

Still, I feel like I get it. I get that feeling.

From the perspective of those idols, large agencies are certainly blessed. You get to be produced with plenty of budget, you’re made to appear on popular TV Programs…

They probably believed from the depth of their hearts that if they could be in that position, they would shine.

**Arashi**: That’s true, huh. A large portion of work revolves around ES, so it’s not strange for there to be people to be holding a grudge.

**Yuuta**: I understand the situation. But, why do we have to cooperate anyway?

Besides, it’s just one online show— isn’t it fine if the victory or defeat of the “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” is just whoever you want?

If anything, it’s not that big of a job, so isn’t it fine to just make them look good— (1)

**Natsume**: UnfortunateLY, that sort of thing can’t happEN.

**Yuuta**: Um?

**Natsume**: Think about iT. “NETV” haS already appointed a director with a stain on his reputation.

WhaT is the reason for inciting the spirit of antagonism in the weaker agency idols till they participate in “staging”?

It’s naturaL to think that there is a reason to purposely let an obscure idol win. For examplE, mayBE it’s more convenient for the management because they’re obscure……♪

**Ibara**: I see. Could it be……

They could be using the “Keynesian beauty contest.”(2)

**Natsume**: HeHE. It’s so helpfuL that you’ve got good judgement, Ibara-kun.

SincE we’re on the topic. The power needed for “staging” to happen. Shall I explain the mechanismS?

<li>Yuuta said ‘isn’t it fine to just bring them flowers’, which means to either make them look good or give them credit.</li>
<li>A “Keynesian beauty contest” is a concept developed by John Maynard Keynes to explain price fluctuations in equity markets. It was originally introduced in his 1936 work “General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money.” It describes a beauty contest scenario in which judges are rewarded for choosing the most popular face among all the judges, rather than the face they personally find most attractive. This equates to stocks in the sense that investors could profit more by buying stocks they think other investors will buy instead of those that fundamentally have the best value.</li>

(Location: “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” program set)

**Ibara**: Is everyone familiar with the “Keynesian beauty contest?”

**Yuuta**: ………?

**Ibara**: Well, it has nothing to do with idols, so you wouldn’t know it.

It’s an analogy for the stock market. In the financial market, the value of a company—its stock price, is determined not by its performance or financial soundness, but by its popularity.

A contest where a vote is held to determine the most beautiful woman out of 100 participants, and a prize will be given to the person who votes for first place—

—When gambling on something like this, voters vote not for the woman they think is beautiful, but for the person they think is beautiful on average.

That’s what we call the Keynesian beauty contest.

If the Keynesian beauty contest were held in “Battle on the Sugoroku Board,” the popularity would probably be shared between the NewDi and CosPro teams.

Popularity has nothing to do with determining who wins or loses “Battle on the Sugoroku Board”…… But it is a consequence of it.

That’s why NETV is trying to let the idols from weaker agencies win, correct?

So they can gamble behind the scenes and profit greatly from the stakes.

**Rinne**: Oi…… Are we the targets of gambling!?

I’d rather join their side!!

**Yuuta**: This gambling addict is a worthless adult.

**Rinne**: Whaddya mean “worthless adult.” You have a weird way of speaking, don’t you.

But that doesn’t explain it. It’s true if an unpopular idol wins, they’ll make a lot of money.

**Arashi**: Natsume-chan said that may be why they brought in a shady director.

It’s been a while since he last worked. He couldn’t turn down the opportunity to produce a program, right?

**Madara**: As a result, he couldn’t escape from this evil deed.

However, NETV is a company that distributes programs overseas, so it’s not illegal is it?

**Natsume**: YeS. The headquarters is located in areas where gambling is legAL. In other worDS, what we’re trying to do is a matter of feeliNGS.

A matter of feelings—nO. It might be more accurate to call it a moral issUE.

Don’t involve us in that shitty “stagING.”

Don’t look down on idOLS.

…… Just for thAT, we’re fighting togethER.

Naturally, this’ll be a blow to those invested in NETV, like Ibara-kUN.

But you don’t just see idols as pawns for your businesses, riGHT?

You just want to make monEY, I’m sure there’s better jobs out theRE.

**Ibara**: Hmm. Are you trying to appeal to compassion?

If they’re not breaking the law, then I have no obligation to cooperate.

In fact, if the company I’m invested in is trying to make money like that, then, from a manager’s perspective, I’m in luck♪

**Rinne**: …… Oi.

**Ibara**: Oh! Don’t lose your temper!

Stable management also means that they can invest in the entertainment industry, where you don’t know whether it’ll hit or miss.

Profits are important for keeping idols alive when their asses are on the line.

In fact, because of this, no-name idols are being used. That fact is unshakable.

**Natsume**: I didn’t think you were that heartlESS. Negotiations have broken down— it looks like the NewDi team has no choice but to try our beST.

**Ibara**: Make no mistake, I’m not saying we won’t cooperate.

I merely told you the facts. There’s a strong will to fight together—but simply fighting together won’t solve this problem.

An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. If you’re hit with capital, you can fight back with capital. That’s how society fights.

If the gambling house is open for us, it’s a matter of joining the table.

For example, raising the bet—what if we raised the stakes?

**Rinne**: Raising the…… Heh, I getcha. We’re in for a do-or-die game.

**Arashi**: Don’t use gambling as an example. We’re still students, aren’t we?

**Yuuta**: Please explain more clearly, vice prez.

**Ibara**: Yes, yes. Don’t worry!

This is just a hypothetical. Do you know what would happen if a bet was being held in front of you, and the person you were betting on won via match-fixing?

You know that only those who know about the match-fixing will benefit immensely, right?

So, what if that match-fixing doesn’t work, and you fail?

Those who know about the match-fixing will be wiped out. The risk and return of match-fixing are balanced because the underdog targets win.

In other words, you do two things. Stop the match-fixing, and then bet big on another candidate.

We’re going to take back the match-fixing. I have a vision in my mind of everyone involved going out onto the streets, and they’d bet so much money that they would win that they’ll consider CosPro a threat!

If we do that, they’ll never gamble again. …… What do you all think? It’ll be quite enjoyable♪

**Natsume**: …… I’m stunnED. I wasn’t telling you to go that fAR.

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/dip50akr.png">

**Ibara**: Ahaha! That’s what it means to make an enemy out of me♪

Philanthropy! Fraternity! Benevolence!

A loving punishment for those who trampled on their love for idols……☆

**Yuuta**: Huh, your catchphrase changed!?

**Ibara**: I don’t know what you’re talking about? I’ve always had a love for idols?

**Yuuta**: Scaryyy…… This person’s really troublesome to make an enemy out of, huh.

**Madara**: I’ve accepted things like that up until now, so I think it’s fine to do whatever you like.

But, that gambling place—it’s open in secret and seems impossible to enter.

Even if it’s not a real place, but an online one.

**Ibara**: Well, I guess I’ll have to look into that now.

In order to ensure the fairness of the gambling, this program is probably broadcast in real time on a site that can’t be accessed from within Japan.

In fact, its real-time nature will support our plans. We can delay the response.

If we ask the complicit production director for information about the gambling parlour, he’ll tell us right away.

He seems to be talented, and just like Natsume-kun, he’s someone who just wants to make a “good program”—

“Staging” may also be accepted as part of the production.

This program, like NETV, is not pandering to existing forces. They want a program that supports the underdog…… And I think I can persuade them to do something like that.

And so, first, we contact His Majesty, who seems to be close to the staff.

If he can back it up, it’ll be the beginnings of a fun show♪

Let’s follow the example of Natsume-kun’s beloved Hibiki-shi and make it a fun event for us too!

**Natsume**: HmM, what kind of cruel drama (Grand Guignol)(1) are you planniNG? If you’re going to use Nii-san as a reference, you should be planning a comeDY.

Just don’t let your vice flourish. If you screw them, they’ll screw you baCK—and on that one point I’ll agree with yOU.

# Epilogue

## 1

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/74db2yoy.png">

(Location: “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” program set)

**Tsumugi**: Hello, is this Natsume-kun?

Yes. I was moved to a place where the surrounding staff wouldn’t hear, and I was told in secret. I’ll send the online casino URL to your device.

**Natsume**: “Thank yOU. Looks like Ibara-kun will send a proxy to participate in it, so I thinK we’ll be able to see something interesting in a short whiLE.”

**Tsumugi**: Ah. Can I say one more thing?

**Natsume**: “What? I’m in the middle of appearing on the show sO I’d like you to be brief.”

**Tsumugi**: Just like the rumor said, it seems the production director-san was exiled from the TV industry due to committing acts of violence.

However, Director-san said there were reasons for that…… It looks like when he was scolding that idol due to having issues with women, it turned into a physical scuffle. 

He looked shameful as he said he “should have handled things like an adult.”

**Natsume**: HmM. So the victim was at fault tOO.

Even so, that doesn’t make his sins disappear, you knOW. Rather, if he’s made complicit with this next evil becauSE of his evil deeds in the past, there is nO room for sympathy.  

But I understaND the situation. The reason whY this project was able to escape the eyes of investigation till the very end.

It’s because evEN in this situation, he’s desperately tryiNG to work. He’s enrapturED by the completion of this game called the “Battle on the Sugoroku Board”.

ThereIN lies our chance to win. I definitely will not let the match-fixing happEN.

(Ten minutes later)

**Arashi**: It’s been quite a bit of time since we started. As things are, I wonder if the exploration area will continue to become smaller?

**Natsume**: That’s righT. The entry-prohibited area should be expanding sooN.

The teaM doing the match-fixing shouLD be running and hiding till the endgame.

**Madara**: If the favourite-to-win team is annihilated due to some sort of mistake…… If that happens it won’t be a joke, theeen.

The other idols are fighting against us ES idols because of sheer grudge, but you wouldn’t think that, behind the scenes, a large sum of money is being moved around.

With such a large-scale match-fixing, there was no telling where the plan would leak out from. What’s more, Tsumugi-san was only able to get that information because the production director had no sense of loyalty.

That’s where the enemy’s weakness lies. Isn’t that so, Natsume-san?

**Natsume**: YeP. The true enemy is probablY in fewer numbers than we originally thought. So, this is what we’ll dO; with the CosPro Team on the west side and the NewDi Team on the east side, we will do a thorough and exhaustive search.

…! Get down!

**Madara**: Did you find them, Natsume-san?

**Natsume**: YeP. Be carefuL. Those idols who arranged the match fixing mighT have been secretly given support items.

However whAT is more frightening in this situation, is being so overly afraid of the opponent that you end up losiNG your cool.

First of all, one person should bE a human sacrifice. (1) Try doing it fair and square, to observe the opponent’s attitude and calmly deal wiTH it.

**Madara**: In that case, I’ll go. If the opponent does something strange— that’ll be the time to use the trick up my sleeve.

**Natsume**: I’ll be counting on yOU. You’ll be able to quickly deal with anY unexpected situation with your unorthodox methodS, Mikejima-senpai.

**Madara**: Hahaha. I’m honoured to receive that compliment ♪

Indeed, I’m used to stuff like that. Relax and leave it to me……♪

Heaven’s vengeance is slow but sure! (2) I request a “Dice Battle” with thee!

Hooo. So that’s your support item.

The “Double Loaded Dice”(3)…..will guarantee at least a 4 on your dice roll. You have a “Substitute Doll” as well, huh.

I see, I’m dealing with a pretty difficult opponent, huh?

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/pdk8xyur.png">

**Madara**: …… Frankly, if you were going to use an item that would break the game for match-fixing, I would have thought up a way to steal your smartphone so I could win by default, but…

If it’s an opponent that I can win against with just the help of items and luck, using this “Triple dice” to battle suits me just weell.

Let’s battle! — Let’s begin the “Dice Battle”!

**Rinne**: Oh. Found a guy that survived in this sorta place!

Let’s go over right now, Yuta! Follow my lead!

**Yuuta**: Eh, Rinne-senpai!? Don’t get ahead of yourself too much—

**Rinne**: Gyaahaha! That doesn’t matter!

Especially since we’re at a playground ya see? It’s a waste to just be a silent spectator♪

**Yuuta**: No, no. Didn’t Vice Prez just discuss that? If we find the opponent, we should first observe their movements—

**Rinne**: ………☆

**Yuuta**: -He said, he’s already heading towards the enemy!

Are you okay with this, Vice Prez? He’s completely ignoring the team’s strategy, you know?

**Ibara**: It’s within expectations. I wasn’t expecting anything from Rinne Amagi-shi from the start. 

I’m holding onto the support items anyway, so even if he loses, the damage will be minor.

**Yuuta**: Can’t trust this guy, huh.

**Ibara**: I do trust him. He’s that sort of person.

Strategy-wise, you can also have a “Dice Battle” to infer the opponent’s movements. Let’s go hide in the shadows and see what they’ve got.

**Rinne**: “Triple Dice” ya say, what’s that? ……It’s an item that increases the number of your dice to three!?

You mean it’s three against one! Is’sa disadvantage, unless I’ve got great luck, I can’t win……!

…… As if. Unfortunately, I get more fired up with stacked odds ☆

I don’t care how many you throw, just come at me with all you got!

Your roll……. “1” “3” “1”! The total is “5”……!

After all, today I’ve got the best luck! Even at a disadvantageous position, I’ll still be surviving by a hair’s breadth!

And then, my roll is—

AlrightAlrightAlright! It’s here! “6”!

What a shame. The goddess of luck is smiling upon *me*♪

…… Huh? You still got something else?

You have a “Reset Card” so you wanna go again……?

Heh, so something like that exists too. Interestiing♪

What sort of item are you going to use next? Show me how serious you can be♪

**Yuuta**: A~ah, I told him so…… Even if he got lucky once, it’s unlikely he’ll win a second time.

**Ibara**: He’s fine like that. Thanks to him, the seed of victory has been revealed.

After all, the opponent doesn’t fight other than the valid scope of the game —In that case, we must put on an utmost challenge while following the rules too.

I’ll fully mobilize the support items. The final winner will be us, the CosPro Team!

(Location: “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” program set)

(10 minutes later)

**Tsumugi**: —What happened, Director-san? You’re looking pale?

Ahaha. Now that you mention it, your phone’s been ringing for a while now, hasn’t it.

I wonder, if the participants who aren’t supposed to lose are losing, then NETV’s people’s phones would be ringing endlessly.

I think it’d be fine to ignore them. Right now, it’s your job to make the program interesting♪

…… If you go on like this, you won’t be able to work in the industry again, will you? Is that really true?

Surely, when “Battle on the Sugoroku Board” is broadcast— it’ll catch the eyes of many people, I think.

In that case, what will the viewers think if they see the current developments? I think we’ll be praised for using our wits and resisting.

Even if there’s circumstances where ES idols are favored by the industry, isn’t it sad to see Natsume-kun and the others now?

It’s more fun than catching glimpses of the program’s true circumstances.

This big turnaround happened because you worked sincerely hard on your production work. The last person to evaluate it is the one who sees that workmanship.

That’s why— I don’t know what other people will say. I, at least, appreciate your work.

“Battle on the Sugoroku Board.” It was a very fun program♪

…… Any time now, NewDi Team and CosPro Team will meet up.

They wanted to use all their gold and support items in a three-on-three battle. It’s a perfect match for “Battle on the Sugoroku Board”’s finale.

Let’s watch it through to the end. I think it would be best to explain what’s happening to the people at NETV later♪

**Natsume**: FuU…… We managed to defeat thEM.

It truly was a fight to the deaTH. It was a victory we were able to obtain by using up all our wits and iteMS.

**Madara**: Nice work, Arashi-san.

**Arashi**: Ufufu. I never thought I’d roll an “18” with the “Triple Dice” and win big. Maybe it’s because of my excellent habits♪

**Natsume**: If anything, we were saved by the design of the “dice battLES.”

Support items with “Dice” in the name can’t be stackED— it was a relief to see that the idols instructed to fix the match were unable to use multiple iteMS.

If they had used “Triple Dice” or “Loaded DiCE,” we wouldn’t have been able to compete with thEM.

NoW, all that’s left is CosPro TeAM—

After defeating the match fixing idols to the east and weST, we obtained an unused “Detection Satellite”— an item that displays the enemy’s GPS.

They were probably planning on using this and the “Disappearing Mantle” to successfully escape until the final stagES. They’ve got no use for it anyway, so I’ll be glad to use iT.

FufU. LoOK, there’s three GPS signals coming towards uS. It’s probably the CosPro TeAM.

**Madara**: Looks like they did it. It’s amazing that the CosPro Team also survived under these circumstances.

**Arashi**: There don’t seem to be any other GPS signals left. At this rate, it seems like it’ll be a one-on-one fight in the end.

Like we discussed before, it’ll be a fair three-on-three battle at the end, and the one who wins two will be the winner— is that right?

**Natsume**: YeS. As expected, doing a winner-takes-all matCH in this situation would get us nowheRE.

In the end, let’s play a fair team matCH.

As I was sayiNG, it looks like they’ve arrivED.

**Ibara**: If it isn’t Natsume-kun! We’ve finally done it!

We had two people on our side, so it was quite a struggle. How are you faring?

**Natsume**: YeS, I feel greAT. Since we’ve come this far, there’s no need to guess what’s going on behind the scenES.

In the eND, I just want to have fun and not think about anythiNG.

**Ibara**: I see. Since we’re here at the end, let’s enjoy the “Dice Battle” without holding anything back!

I’m also in a great mood now that I’ve been able to administer a good scolding to troublesome coworkers! It’s been a long time since I’ve been able to forget about work and have fun……☆

**Arashi**: Ufufu. The two of them are getting excited. …… Then, I guess I’ll battle with Yuuta-chan♪

**Yuuta**: Eh? Me?

**Arashi**: Yes. We got caught up in a lot of adult stuff today. Besides, we hardly talk to each other, don’t we?

Sometimes I want to play with younger children, so I’d be happy if I could do so with you♪

Of course, I’m not going to lose easily. How about we use all of the items we’ve acquired so far to compete?

**Yuuta**: Fufu. Then I’ll use “Triple Dice” as well. Let’s finish this to the bitter end♪

I also have a “Reroll Card” and “Substitute Doll!” Since I’ve made it here, I’m going to fight with cheat-class items♪

**Madara**: Hahaha. Maybe it’s because of the match-fixing, but everyone seems to be using items as they please. It’s a big treat♪

Shall we leftovers fight it out, Rinne-san?

**Rinne**: Alright, I’ll take you up on it!

I was just thinking that we didn’t get to have enough fun♪ Let’s enjoy it ‘til the end♪

It’s an all or nothing do-or-die match between all six members!

**Natsume and Ibara**: The dice rolls a—!

**Natsume and Ibara**: ………!

**Natsume**: —Fufu, the battle’s ovER.

(For that reason, the winner is — Newdi Team!)

**Ibara**: A wonderful battling style!I would not have expected you to hide that you still had a “Loaded Dice” till the very end! It was a psychological warfare befitting of the climax.

Let me formally congratulate you! I hail the The NewDi Team for having fought bravely……☆

I’m really glad to have seen the ins and outs of this program and have been able to enjoy playing games. I hope when the time for the broadcast comes, once again the advertisements—

**Yuuta**: Eeh, Rinne-senpai froze on the spot, unable to move……!?

**Natsume**: That’s an amazing effeCT. So he was thAT tired.

Since it’s rare, why don’t we take a pictuRE? It’s rare for Ibara-kun to expose such a vulnerable sleeping expression, after aLL ♪

**Arashi**: That’s definitely in poor taste isn’t it, Natsume-chan?

But, somehow I feel like Ibara-chan, too, was able to forget about work and enjoy himself in the end.

His sleeping face looks like he’s having fun…… right?

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Sugoroku/2nt7b9sd.png">

(Location: CosPro conference area)

(Cospro Office. Several days after the recording of “Battle on the Sugoroku Board”.)

**Ibara**: ………

Yes, this is Saegusa. This is about the matter we discussed before, I take it?

Are you willing to take up the aforesaid supplementary funding for “NETV”? That’s most wonderful.

It was a surprise to me too. To think there was someone of unusual tastes carrying out gambling behind the scenes of “Battle on the Sugoroku Board”, and that their predictions were greatly mistaken! 

But please rest assured. From now on, I’ll be investing even more funds into the project planning of “NETV” shows and supporting the program broadcasted for overseas.

In return, we will no longer allow for the program to be used as the subject of gambling. It’s also written in the contract, but just in case, please confirm it.

…… No. I don’t have any enthusiasm for idols, but I’m after all someone who sells an image. I just wanted to keep it clean. 

Since internet programs are still an area still in its infancy stage, if we don’t probably hold the reins to it, it could turn out good or bad.

If the overseas office becomes a front for gambling, it’ll become our Achilles’ heel.

Even if you made an excellent program, if that sort of thing comes to light, it’ll be like bubbles coming onto the surface; all for naught…….

Managing a business while exposing one’s weakness is difficult even for me…… I hope you can accept all the terms ♪

Now then, please send over the documents. I will be counting on your help ☆
