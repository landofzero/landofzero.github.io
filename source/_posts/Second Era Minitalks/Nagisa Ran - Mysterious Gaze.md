(Location: Break Room)

**Nagisa**: …… Hello, it looks like you’re here for a break too, aren’t you?

…… As you can see, I’m reading a magazine. I’m going to be doing bridal work so I decided to do some studying.

…… Anzu-san, sometimes I feel like people passing by are looking at me strangely. It’s making me wonder, am I doing something strange?

> Option 1: I think it’s because of the magazine.

**Nagisa**: …… I see. Maybe everyone misunderstood and thought I was thinking of getting married.

…… Fufu, I don’t think it’s very likely that a person’s thoughts are the same as the content of the book they’re reading.

> Option 2: You’re not doing anything strange.

**Nagisa**: …… Really? That’s a relief.

…… I’ve been receiving strange messages from Ibara for some time now. He asked where I was, so I told him I was in the break room.

> Option 3: If I had to say……

**Nagisa**: …… Is that so? I see, so by reading this, others may think that I’m looking to marry someone else.

…… I don’t know why they’d think that way, but I’ll be careful to not read it in public spaces from now on.

(Location: Break Room)

**Nagisa**: …… I feel like I understand what marriage is by reading this magazine, but I’d like a little more information.

…… If you don’t mind, could you please tell me your opinion, Anzu-san?

…… What does marriage mean to you?

> Option 1: I’m not sure.

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu, it’s certainly difficult to understand something you haven’t experienced.

…… I think it would be better to ask staff members who have families for their opinions.

> Option 2: It’s a big event in a person’s life.

**Nagisa**: …… Certainly, from reading that magazine, it seems that people who get married need a lot of preparation.

…… Outfits, the venue, food…… I guess there’s a lot to prepare.

> Option 3: I haven’t thought much about it.

**Nagisa**: …… It’s true that there are probably not many people our age who have thoughts about marriage.

…… I’m sorry for asking you difficult questions.

# Episode 3

(Location: Break Room)

**Nagisa**: …… Ah, Hiyori-kun contacted me. It seems like it’s time to move on to the next job.

…… The next location? Come to think of it, where is it?

…… Ah, it’s at S TV . Hiyori-kun wrote it clearly in the message.

> Option 1: Please do your best at work.

**Nagisa**: …… Thank you.

…… I wonder if Anzu-san will continue taking a break here after this. I don’t need this magazine anymore, so I’ll give it to you.

> Option 2: Should I escort you to S TV?

**Nagisa**: …… Are you perhaps worried I might get lost along the way?

…… It’s alright. Don’t worry, I’ll head straight there.

> Option 3: Are you recording something?

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. I’m planning to appear on a music program with Eden.

…… Everyone’s been busy lately, so it’s been a while since we’ve all gathered together for a recording.
