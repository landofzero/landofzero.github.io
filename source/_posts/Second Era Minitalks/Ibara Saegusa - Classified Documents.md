**Ibara**: …… Whew. For now, all the documents are organized.

Please don’t thank me over and over. It’s only natural for me to help Producer-dono……☆

I’m always available to help, if you’re alright with that.

> Option 1: Thank you.

**Ibara**: I’d like to just say “You’re welcome,” but…… To begin with, wasn’t it impossible for you to handle this amount of material on your own?

Even if you don’t want to admit it to yourself, I think if you had relied on someone from the start, the work would have been completed much faster.

> Option 2: I’ll pay you back next time.

**Ibara**: I paid for the help myself, so there’s no need for you to worry……

So, let’s say you owe me one. If I ever need your help, I’ll be sure to contact you.

> Option 3: Sorry for taking up your time.

**Ibara**: Hm, Anzu-san is as humble as ever. That may be seen as a virtue by the other idols……

Anyway, don’t worry about me. I’m used to dealing with documents of this size all the time.

(Location: CosPro Offices)

**Ibara**: So, what is this vast amount of material for?

Like you, I’m also in the position of being a producer. I think I have the right to ask that much.

…… Materials for a new program? That’s not a very clear answer. Is there something you’re trying to keep secret?

> Option 1: I’m sorry!

**Ibara**: …… Oops. If you bow your head that vigorously, the papers you’re holding will start an avalanche.

I realize there are circumstances that make a reserved person like Anzu-san apologise. Please don’t bow your head repeatedly.

> Option 2: Uummm……

**Ibara**: Your eyes wandered, you’re at a loss for words, and you hesitated…… Your agitation and impatience are showing too much in your attitude.

It’s okay if you just tell me you can’t reveal it yet. As someone who works in the same industry, I can’t say that I don’t understand the situation.

> Option 3: You’re perceptive.

**Ibara**: Ahaha☆ If you reply like that, it’s like you’re confessing that there are things you want to keep secret.

Well, I won’t force you to confess. If it’s a job you’re involved in, chances are I’ll have a chance to find out about it someday.

# Episode 3

(Location: CosPro Offices)

**Ibara**: …… Hm? Excuse me, I received a message from His Highness Hiyori. Pardon me while I check my phone.

Hm. His Highness was asking “When are you coming?” I should have told him I would be late due to work to begin with……

It’s nothing, I was just planning to have dinner with Eden tonight. Come to think of it, it’s almost time for the meeting to begin.

> Option 1: You have to go soon……!

**Ibara**: I’ll head over once I see that you’ve safely delivered the finished documents.

Therefore, please be careful to not accidentally fall or cause the documents to fall apart. …… Then, take care.

> Option 2: Sorry, it’s my fault.

**Ibara**: It’s not an issue. As I said earlier, I had originally planned to join them late.

However, if I wait too long, His Excellency and Jun will likely press me to hurry up……I’ll close the office and head out.

> Option 3: Are you gonna be alright?

**Ibara**: He doesn’t seem angry, so don’t worry. The restaurant is nearby, so I can get there right away,

The restaurant has a good reputation for its taste and atmosphere. If you accept my invitation, I’ll introduce it to you next time.
