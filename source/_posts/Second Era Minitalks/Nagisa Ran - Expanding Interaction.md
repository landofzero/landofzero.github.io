(Location: CosPro Conference Area)

**Nagisa**: …… The other day, Kaoru-kun told me about marine sports. You can enjoy marine sports even in winter.

…… If you wear a wetsuit and take proper measures against the cold, there shouldn’t be any problems.

…… Now that I think about it, I’ve often seen people enjoying surfing even in the winter.

> Option 1: Surely……

**Nagisa**: …… From the looks of it, Anzu-san also seemed to have the impression that marine sports were a summer thing.

…… I wonder what it feels like to go into the ocean in the winter. I wonder if I can have a different experience than in the summer.

> Option 2: That looks interesting.

**Nagisa**: …… Heeh. I wonder if Anzu-san is interested in marine sports. If that’s the case, just ask Kaoru-kun and he’ll be happy to tell you I think.

…… He seemed to be knowledgeable not only about marine sports, but also about activities at sea.

> Option 3: Marine sports, huh……

**Nagisa**: …… According to Kaoru-kun, diving and snorkeling also fall under marine sports.

…… I wasn’t familiar with the word itself either. When I found out what it meant, I was surprised to see there were many different types.

**Nagisa**: …… Kaoru-kun often tells me stories about the ocean and surfing, so I might have become a little more interested.

…… It seems like the hurdles are high for me to start on my own, but he seems to be teaching me lots of things.

…… But, I don’t have any plans yet.

> Option 1: Let me know what you think.

**Nagisa**: …… Alright. If you have any experience surfing, I would like to hear from you.

…… Anzu-san might have beat me to it though. Could you tell me your impressions then?

> Option 2: Hopefully your schedule is set soon.

**Nagisa**: …… If I don’t have a schedule then I won’t be able to go to the beach. I have the same opinion as you.

…… But I wonder when I’ll be free? I’ll have to check with Ibara.

> Option 3: Good for you.

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. I never thought I would make friends who would talk to me about going surfing together.

…… My relationship with Kaoru-kun deepened because we shared a room, so I think the current room assignment was a good thing.

**Nagisa**: …… Compared to other people, I think I have less experience hanging out with friends.

…… What about Anzu-san? You’re always busy, so I don’t think you have much time to hang out or go out with others.

…… Have you hung out with anyone recently?

> Option 1: I haven’t……

**Nagisa**: …… I see. But I feel like you want to hang out or go out.

…… We’re not friends, but if it’s okay with you, I’ll hang out with you. You can call me anytime.

> Option 2: Now that you mention it……

**Nagisa**: …… Hmm. You had tea with Ibara at Cafe Cinnamon. But I’m sure since it’s the two of you that you talked about work.

…… If you had tea, then you might have been able to take a breather, but I don’t think you could say that you had fun.

> Option 3: The other day……

**Nagisa**: …… When we basked in the sun together? Fufu, that’s right.

…… We were able to enjoy the warmth of the sun. And although it may not be the same as hanging out, I think we had a peaceful time.
