# Trouble Talking One

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Yorishiro/mpkjxpcb.png">

(Location: RhyLin Office (Conference Area))

**Adonis**: Sorry, Hakaze-senpai. Did I make you wait?

**Kaoru**: Nah, I just got here so don’t worry about it. Especially since I was the one who suddenly called you here, Adonis-kun.

Ah, would you like some tea? If you’re thirsty I can make you a cup of coffee or something.

**Adonis**: No, I’m fine. What did you want to talk to me about?

The matter was so important that Hakaze-senpai went out of your way to call me here. If I don’t hear about it soon, I’ll be restless.

**Kaoru**: Ahaha. You don’t have to be so nervous. Come on now, relax, relax♪

Well if you’re so interested in it, then let’s get straight to the point.

Adonis-kun, would you like to try being a talk show MC?

**Adonis**: …… The MC of a talk show? Me? This must be some kind of mistake, is it not?

**Kaoru**: Well, that’s how you would react. Let me tell you the details first.

There’s a program that I was offered, and it’s a talk show where two idols get together for a discussion.

**Adonis**: In that case, I think Hakaze-senpai should just accept the offer……

**Kaoru**: Yeah, well, I was thinking of just accepting it if nothing interfered, but the scheduled recording date for that program overlapped with something else I had scheduled.

As expected, I can’t change the schedule anymore. But I also want to avoid changing the recording date of the talk show as much as possible.

So I contacted them to decline the offer, but then they told me that if I had any ideas for a replacement to let them know.

**Adonis**: I see. So you made me your substitute……

However, Hakaze-senpai knows I’m not good at talking. I don’t think I could ever fill in for you.

**Kaoru**: I do know that you’re not good at talking, so I’m not going to force you.

But you’ve also appeared on lots of shows with us, so I feel like you’ve become more adjusted to it.

That’s why I think it’s worth taking the plunge and trying it out to get rid of your feelings of not being good at it.

Isn’t it a good idea to think of this as an opportunity for growth and to give it a try?

**Adonis**: I’m happy to have an opportunity to grow but…… is it alright to have this kind of mindset for it?

**Kaoru**: That’s alright. I asked in advance if it would be okay to even suggest kids who can’t talk well and they said yes.

So the rest is up to what you want to do. If you really don’t like it then I’ll tell them no, so what do you want to do?

**Adonis**: ………

…… I also thought that it was a problem that I always felt like I couldn’t talk well.

So if I have a chance to overcome that, then I would like to try it.

**Kaoru**: Alright, understood. Well then, I’ll tell the program staff my official answer.

Good luck, Adonis-kun♪

(On the other side. CosPro at the same time)

**Nagisa**: …… I see. So Ibara wants to find a substitute for that talk show.

**Ibara**: Indeed. At this time of year, Eve has jobs that cannot be taken away, so I had no choice but to decline the offer given to his Highness Hiyori.

They said it would be possible to get a substitute, so it’ll be either of us from Adam. I’d like to deal with it myself……

However, I’m finding it difficult to deal with it because I’m busy with various production operations. Which means……

**Nagisa**: …… Which means I’m the only candidate.

**Ibara**: But I’m very worried about whether it’s alright to send Your Excellency alone on a talk show that requires flexibility.

**Nagisa**: …… When I’m alone, you’re anxious all the same.

**Ibara**: No no, I have confidence in Your Excellency’s abilities.

If you’re fully prepared, you’re sure to achieve a comfortable victory on any battlefield. Ahaha♪

**Nagisa**: …… Conversely, wouldn’t this instance be a situation where sufficient preparation isn’t possible?

**Ibara**: …… Oh dear, I truly admire Your Excellency’s insight. That’s certainly true.

There are many elements in the conversation that are difficult to predict. For example, your conversation partner.

Most recently, I’ve heard that Rhythm Link would invite Hakaze-shi. However, they also seem to be having trouble adjusting their schedule.

There’s a possibility that they’ll have a substitute as well. In that case, it’s unknown who the other party will be.

Personally, I believe that Your Excellency can respond as you are without preparing a script……

Depending on who you’re talking to, there’s a possibility that they’ll attack you if you let your guard down, so it’s safer to have some measures in place.

However, in situations where you can’t discern the enemy, you can only make vague plans……

**Nagisa**: …… So you plan to decline the offer?

**Ibara**: I want to avoid refusing it as much as possible……

We are currently pursuing a strategy to promote Eden through various media.

That’s why I want to take on as many jobs as possible to let the world know about Eden’s existence.

**Nagisa**: …… If that’s the case, this program will also be a part of that, wouldn’t it?

…… If so, I’ll take care of it.

**Ibara**: What? But Your Excellency, is it really okay to do it alone?

**Nagisa**: …… I just have to do what I normally do with Ibara without Ibara. I think I can do it on my own.

**Ibara**: Of course, in a nutshell, that’s what it means. It’s hard for me to even show up at the recording site this time, you know?

**Nagisa**: …… I understand. Even still, this is work that Ibara believes is worth doing.

…… That’s why you said you wanted to avoid rejecting the offer as much as possible. Am I wrong?

**Ibara**: Yes, it’s as Your Excellency says.

**Nagisa**: …… In that case, you just need to wish me a few words. If you do that, I’ll do my best for Ibara too.

**Ibara**: …… Understood. Then, in this case, I’ll leave it to you, Your Excellency.

Well, thanks to Your Excellency’s powerful words, I was finally able to make a decision. Thank you very much.

# Trouble Talking Two

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Yorishiro/sr5w5qjp.png">

(Location: ES Hallway)

(A few days later. The day of the talk show meeting)

**Nagisa**: …… Oh, hello, Anzu-san. It’s nice to see you today.

…… You’re coming to today’s talk show meeting, right?

…… Yes. I’m glad I got it right, I thought maybe I had misunderstood.

…… Usually, Ibara keeps track of every detail, but this time I’m on my own.

…… Come to think of it, the person I’ll be conversing with on the program is Adonis-kun.

…… I’ve talked with him at the Starmony Dorms, but we didn’t have many opportunities to casually talk with each other.

…… So I’m glad to have the opportunity to talk with him at length this time.

…… Oops, this isn’t the time to be standing around talking. We’ll be late for the meeting. Let’s hurry up a little, Anzu-san.

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Yorishiro/rfep7mlj.png">

(Location: Meeting Room)

**Nagisa**: …… Hello, Adonis-kun. I’m sorry I made you wait.

**Adonis**: ………

**Nagisa**: …… Adonis-kun? Is something wrong?

…… He won’t respond even when Anzu-san calls out to him. He’s been staring at something for a while now.

…… Is that the program proposal you were given in advance?

**Adonis**: …… Hm? Anzu and Ran-senpai, you’re already here? Sorry, I didn’t know you had arrived.

**Nagisa**: …… Don’t worry about it. You must have been so focused that you didn’t even notice us getting here.

**Adonis**: I was just nervous, so I’ve read very little of it.

**Nagisa**: (…… It’s true that his grip is so strong that the part where he’s holding the proposal is wrinkled.

…… It seems Adonis-kun’s nervousness is more intense than I thought.)

**Adonis**: Sorry, Anzu, Ran-senpai. I might cause issues for the both of you.

**Nagisa**: …… What do you mean by that?

**Adonis**: I’m not good at talking. So I’m not confident that I’ll be able to talk well.

I once appeared on a radio program with UNDEAD, but at the time I was able to do it because of Hakaze-senpai and Oogami’s support.

So I might end up causing trouble for Ran-senpai this time.

**Nagisa**: …… I see. I understand why you apologized.

…… But if you knew you weren’t good at talking, why did you accept the job?

**Adonis**: …… Because I wanted to grow more as an idol.

Idols don’t just sing and dance. I want to do more for my fans.

But that’s my side of things. It’s unrelated to the people who will be inconvenienced by my failure.

So I feel like I should apologize in advance to you, Ran-senpai……

**Nagisa**: …… I understand your feelings.

…… You’re kind and honest. I think that’s wonderful.

…… Actually, I’m the same as you, Adonis-kun.

**Adonis**: The same as me? What does that mean?

**Nagisa**: …… It would be easier for me to have Ibara’s instructions, but right now the agency’s policy is to show my earnest self.

…… But I still don’t know the correct answer as to how to show my earnest self.

…… I thought that not knowing the correct way to behave was similar to not being good at talking.

**Adonis**: I see. I guess Ran-senpai was worried like I was.

**Nagisa**: …… That’s why we should both do our best to grow through this recording.

…… It’s precisely because we’re imperfect that we can find the joy in growth.

**Adonis**: You’re right. Hearing you say that made me feel at ease. Thank you.

**Nagisa**: …… I’m glad your tension seems to have eased. I’m sorry for keeping Anzu-san waiting too.

…… Fufu, I’m glad you don’t mind. Thank you.

…… The start time has already passed, so let’s begin the meeting quickly.

(A few minutes later)

**Adonis**: —I see. In other words, this time we’ll have to listen to the concerns of our viewers.

The program has already prepared an application form and is collecting information from viewers about what they’d like to discuss with us.

The content is…… Right. We still can’t see it can we?

“We’ll ask the two of you to choose a problem that will be featured on the program later,” huh. Understood.

**Nagisa**: …… The difficult thing is that it’s not enough for the both of us to just talk about the issues.

…… Adonis-kun and I have received a reputation in the eyes of the public as being “adult-like,” and the program wants to make use of that reputation.

…… So they would like us to solve the problems with calm, adult-like advice and have a discussion related to those problems.

**Adonis**: …… Even just talking to someone is difficult, so I wonder if I’ll be able to do it.

**Nagisa**: …… The part I added is only a request on the part of the program. If it’s too difficult, I think they can decide if it’s possible to leave that part out.

…… That part is just a decoration to make the program even more exciting. So what’s most important here is the content.

**Adonis**: Content. In other words, they’re asking for help with a problem……

To begin with, we have the problem of not being good at talking, but I wonder if we can do something that big……

**Nagisa**: …… I agree. If you suddenly asked me if I could do that, I would have my doubts too.

…… In the end, I guess we have to do a rehearsal together first?

**Adonis**: Rehearsal? Do you mean to practice beforehand?

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. You won’t know what the problem is unless you try it out first.

# Trouble Talking Three

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Yorishiro/lxmem8ku.png">

(Location: Starmony Dorms Common Room)

(After several hours. In the Starmony Dorms Common Room)

**Nagisa**: …… Are you ready, Adonis-kun?

**Adonis**: Yes, this isn’t a studio, but we were asked to discuss your concerns as if we were recording in a studio.

………

Is it okay if I check the script for a moment?

**Tsumugi**: Eh? Do you have a proper script? If so, I’ll have to check it too……

**Sora**: It’s important to check the script~! Sora will also check it!

**Nagisa**: …… Calm down. We don’t have a script prepared.

**Adonis**: …… Now that I think about it, you’re right. When I thought this was the same as the real thing, I couldn’t help but feel like I needed to check it.

**Natsume**: JeEZ. Are you going to be okay if you’re like that before we even staRT?

**Nagisa**: …… I’m sure it’ll be fine. I hope Natsume-kun also feels free to consult with us.

**Natsume**: I’m not sure I’m fine with the way things are going right now, thoUGH?

In any case, it’s not necessaRY. I’m only here because Sora said he wanted to support you gUYS.

**Sora**: He and Hunter Onii-san said they wanted to practice counseling our worries~

Sora is also having troubles right now, so it’s perfect timing. When someone’s in trouble, we’re here to help each other~♪

**Natsume**: If you’re worried about somethiNG, you can talk to ME. Sora is very kiND……

I’ll hold my tongue for now out of respect for Sora’s kindnESS, but don’t say anything strange to hIM.

As long as you stick to that, you can do whatever you liKE. Don’t expect any advice from me, thoUGH.

**Tsumugi**: Natsume-kun is acting mean again. He’s the best person to talk to about your worries……

**Nagisa**: …… I’d appreciate it if I could even just assess things. Thank you, everyone from Switch.

…… I wonder if Adonis-kun will also be fine soon?

**Adonis**: Yes. I’m fine now. Let’s begin, Ran-senpai.

**Nagisa**: …… Alright. Then, let’s begin, shall we?

…… Thank you for coming to our trouble counseling center today.

…… Today, the MC for the program is I, Ran Nagisa from Eden, and…

**Adonis**: UNDEAD’s Otogari Adonis. It’s a pleasure to…… It’s nice to meet you, isn’t it~?

**Sora**: Nice to meet you~! Clap clap clap☆

**Natsume**: ………?

**Adonis**: Well, let’s begin discussing your concerns right…… Let’s get started?

**Nagisa**: …… It seems three lost lambs have gathered here today. Shall we hear from Tsumugi-kun first?

**Tsumugi**: Wa!? So it’s my turn. Right~, my recent worries are~……

Ah, actually, I feel like my shoulders have been getting a little heavier lately~. What should I do about this?

**Natsume**: (…… He’s working too muCH. Knowing senpAI, he’s likely been falling asleep while sitting on a chaIR.)

**Adonis**: I see. It seems like you’re worried your shoulders are getting heavier. …… It sounds like you have a problem, huh?

I think you just don’t get enough exercise…… What do you think, Ran-senpai……?

**Nagisa**: …… Adonis-kun, maybe Tsumugi-kun’s condition is more serious than you thought.

**Tsumugi**: Ehhh!? No way, I was just looking for some light hearted advice!?

**Adonis**: Wh-what do you mean, Ran-senpai? Could Aoba-senpai be seriously ill!?

**Nagisa**: …… Indeed. First of all, I want you to calm down and listen.

…… There are two main reasons why a person’s shoulders become heavy. Do you know what those are?

**Adonis**: No. I don’t know at all. All I can think of is that he’s worn out from a lack of exercise……

**Nagisa**: …… It seems so. You have two choices: you’re tired or you’re possessed.

**Adonis**: …… What?

**Nagisa**: …… It’s fine if he’s just tired, but if he’s possessed, we need to do something right away.

…… I think we should immediately put salt in the four corners of the room. What do you think, Adonis-kun?

**Adonis**: ………

**Nagisa**: …… Adonis-kun?

**Adonis**: Ah, ahh…… Hm. It’s true that salt intake is important even during exercise. …… It’s important, right?

**Nagisa**: …… That’s right. It’s true that the purifying effect may be high if administered internally.

…… Yes. I’ve come to a conclusion. Tsumugi-kun should lick salt right now.

**Natsume**: (He can’t help but rush into IT. This isn’t a matter of consultation, it’s a one-liner quiz comedy (1) segmENT……)

**Tsumugi**: I see~. Admittedly, I never thought of licking salt. Thank you very much.

**Natsume**: I’m disappointed in you, senpAI.

**Tsumugi**: Ehh!? No way, did I do something wrong?

**Adonis**: Ahem. Can we move on to the next one? I’d like to hear about Harukawa’s concerns…… Right?

**Sora**: HaHa~♪ Finally we get to talk about Sora’s worries, right? Thank you very much!

There’re so many things Sora wants these days that Sora’s having trouble deciding how to spend his money.

Sora wants to buy a new game, but his dad recommended he save money.

**Natsume**: So Sora was worried about thAT. If there’s something you want, just tell ME.

**Sora**: HiHi~, Sora can’t keep being spoiled by Shisho~. Money management is important.

**Nagisa**: …… Hm. Do you save for the future or spend on recreation to satisfy yourself now?

…… This is a very difficult question. It’s generally agreed upon that it’s better to save money, but this is not necessarily the case for Sora-kun.

**Adonis**: …… It’s certainly difficult. Why do you want to save money, Harukawa?

**Sora**: There are a few reasons~. But most important is, as Sora’s dad said, to save for Sora’s future. There’s no need to worry if you’re prepared~!

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Yorishiro/nnl3etce.png">

**Nagisa**: …… Sora-kun only talked about the two options of buying or saving, but there’s also the option of “investing.”

**Adonis**: …… “Investing”? What’s that?

**Sora**: HuHu~! Sora knows. Get rich quick, or be broke. It’s a money game where you play for money~♪

**Adonis**: Fighting each other? I can’t let Harukawa do something so dangerous.

**Nagisa**: …… You don’t actually fight each other. Sora-kun’s example is more of an example used in gambling.

…… It’s true that investing has similar aspects, but compared to gambling, it’s a healthy economic activity.

…… Saving money doesn’t make the economy go around. And, if you spend it on games, it’ll disappear as a momentary pleasure.

…… In that case, it would be better for the future to increase your capital by “investing.” I’m sure Ibara would say this.

**Adonis**: …… Is that so? Then, would it be better to recommend investment?

**Nagisa**: …… No, that’s not necessarily the case. After all, investing carries the risk of failure. I cannot recommend it in confidence.

**Adonis**: Then how should I respond to Harukawa’s concerns?

**Nagisa**: …… There’s a Ouija board here that I suspect was left here by the Mystery Researchers.

…… Let’s use this to summon spirits and ask them for the best answer to Sora-kun’s troubles.

**Natsume**: Stop stOP. That’s enough, stOP.

The end result is that if an amateur fails to rely on spirits properly, he will be curSED. Sora shouldn’t be involved in such a dangerous thiNG.

HaaH…… JeEZ. I feel like I’m watching a manzai show under the guise of helping people with their problEMS.

# Trouble Talking Four

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Yorishiro/1vowpapw.png">

(Location: Starmony Dorms Common Room)

**Adonis**: For the time being, this is our situation. When you’ve received the consultation, please point out any possible issues.

**Nagisa**: …… There’s no need for you to hold back. Getting constructive criticism on any issues can help us prepare for the actual day.

**Tsumugi**: Is that so~ If we’re talking about variety shows, I think it’ll be fine, though.

**Sora**: U~n. Still, it sure was interesting to see Hunter Onii-san thinking in circles~

**Adonis**: So you really thought so. I was aware that it would be better to keep silent, but……

**Tsumugi**: Have you thought of something, Natsume-kun? Was there anything that caught your eye?

**Natsume**: …… Why are you asking mE? I’ve said from the start that I was supposED to only be observing.

**Tsumugi**: Please don’t say that. Of course if it’s about consultation for your worries, it can’t be anyone but Natsume-kun.

Natsume-kun is the one with the most plentiful experience as a personality in radio shows after all.

Even earlier, the person who stopped Nagisa-kun and the rest’s practice was Natsume-kun. Isn’t there a lot of advice you can give them?

**Natsume**: Well noW……I just couldn’t help but take a jab at it.

**Adonis**: On the contrary, if there are issues, please point them out. I’ll be counting on your help.

**Nagisa**: ……I’m counting on you for help as well.

**Natsume**: ………

**Sora**: Shisho~ Sora is asking for your help too. They really do give off the feeling of wanting to do the consultation for people’s concerns~

Besides, for the sake of people asking these two for help, Sora feels like we shouldn’t ignore this.

**Natsume**: …… I get iT, Sora. I never intended to ignore theM.

I can seE that if I continue to ignore this, it will cause sorrow to a lot of peoplE.

**Adonis**: …… You’re even going that far. Are we really in that terrible of a condition?

**Natsume**: MM. Let me express my frank opinion, thougH. That can noT be called a consultation for your worries.

If it’s a proper comedy show. In which casE, if you just watched variety shows like Senpai suggested, there should be nO particular problems.

HoweveR, the show’s concept that I heard from you before this was ‘An adult-like, calm atmosphere’ righT? If that is so, I can only say it’s noT good.

**Nagisa**: …… I see. More specifically, which part of it wasn’t good?

**Natsume**: FirstlY, Ado-chan-kun’s word usage is a little odD? What were you trying tO do?

**Adonis**: It was that uncomfortable, huh…… The truth is, I was imitating Hakaze-senpai.

This time, I’m Hakaze-senpai’s substitute. I thought that if it’s Hakaze-senpai, he would comply with the TV show’s “An adult-like, calm atmosphere” so I used him as a reference.

**Nagisa**: …… Ah, I can probably understand how that feels. Because I’m participating in this TV show as a substitute too, for Hiyori-kun.

…… It’s nice if I could serve as a proper substitute.

**Natsume**: I’ll comment on that in relation to Ran-senpai lateR. For the time being, it’s okaY for Ado-chan-kun to not imitate Hakaze-senpai.

**Adonis**: Is that okay? In that case, what should I do…..

**Natsume**: It’s fine to not imitate anyone, you knoW. Ado-chan-kun seems calm and collected enough without doing anythinG.

**Tsumugi**: That’s right. It could be that the TV show chose Otogari-kun and Nagisa-kun as substitutes because you two already fit the concept they wanted to base the program on.

The two of you already have the “adult like, calm atmosphere” in you. You don’t have to be acting weird for it.

**Adonis**: Is that so…..? Thank you, Sakasaki, Aoba-senpai. In that case, I’ll try my best as myself.

**Natsume**: Well anywaY, even if you overthink it, Ado-chan-kun won’t have problems one way or another I thinK.

From mY point of vieW, this time it’s more like a ‘WhaT’s going on with Ran-senpai?’ kind of feelinG.

**Nagisa**: …… Is that so? Is there something I did wrong?

**Natsume**: The topics you choose and the way you carry yourself are too eccentriC, Ran-senpai. 

Like suddenly starting a one-liner quiz comedy (1) segment, oR trying to start a seance. What did you use as referencE?

**Nagisa**: …… Maybe it was the old talk show from the past that I watched for reference. The comedian performing in it was very funny.

…… Because the show’s staff said they would be thankful if instead of making it serious all throughout the show, I could insert something that could make you slip out a laugh.

…… With that in mind, I tried to copy that comedian’s speaking style. So that’s not good, I see.

**Natsume**: If it’s a comedy-focused variety show, it woulD be exciting, so I thinK it’ll be good.

However, sincE this time they’re looking for an adult-like, calm atmosphere, I thinK it would be better to have a little self control.

Your partner Ado-chan-kun didn’t seem to be particularly able to keep up with you too, sO it was unnecessary.

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Yorishiro/4w3b6hej.png">

**Sora**: Everyone says that a conversation is like playing catch. It’s important to throw a ball that your opponent can catch~♪

**Natsume**: Mm mm, Sora is a good kiD♪ What Sora just said is all there is, you seE.

This time since we’re here, it didn’t turn out to be a dialogue format buT the next time would be the real deal where it’s just you two, you knoW.

You shoulD be more aware of trying to keep the conversation going, so that the two of you can understand each otheR.

**Nagisa**: …… As you said, I might have held off on that awareness this time. Thank you Natsume-kun, Sora-kun.

**Natsume**: …… StilL, this time Ran-senpai’s talk show is especially scattereD. BuT you didn’t seem that bad wheN I was watching your usual activities.

**Nagisa**: …… Maybe I got too excited. I still don’t know how to adjust when Ibara isn’t here.

**Natsume**: I seE. You meaN if Ibara-kun is here, you’d be able to do things as usual?

**Nagisa**: …… Because up till now, I’ve been behaving according to Ibara’s directions.

…… But it seems that Ibara is currently thinking up ways to support me just as I am.

…… That’s why this time I want to show off my earnest self during this job.

**Natsume**: WelL, it feels likE it would be okay if you do whatever you wanT. But according to what you just said, as long as Ran-senpai has an outline prepared, you would be finE?

If that’s the casE, there iS one good solution.

**Nagisa**: …… A solution? Is there a way to properly bring out my earnest self?

**Natsume**: Or rather, would it be more accurate to say that it would be to avoid acting rashlY?

FranklY, all you have to do is to write your own script beforehanD.

You shoulD be able to choose the concerns from the list the show will present to you before recording. It would be easy enough to answer the concerns that you’re already anticipating, righT?

# Trouble Talking Five

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Yorishiro/9d21gay3.png">

(Location: Meeting Room)

(Several days later. Meeting Room inside the ES building.)

**Adonis**: Thank you, Anzu. You’ve given us so many of these letters.

**Nagisa**: …… You went out of your way to print this out for us. It must have been difficult to carry these all the way here, thank you.

…… We just have to choose between all these concerns to discuss on the show, right?

**Adonis**: It’s going to be hard to choose between them. Anyway, it feels like we can look over everything by today.

Mm? Ah,  we’ll be fine. Today we’ll just be reading the letters here.

That’s why you shouldn’t be bothered by us, Anzu. You can go to your next job. Thank you for personally coming all the way to see us.

**Nagisa**: …… Anzu-san seems so busy.

**Adonis**: It hasn’t even been a month since the new year. It seems like she’s busy with project planning for a new TV program. 

**Nagisa**: …… Is that so? We should work hard too so that we don’t become a burden for Anzu-san.

…… It would be better for us to pick a concern quickly to write that script in advance.

**Adonis**: Yes. It’s great that we were able to find a solution thanks to talking to Sakasaki.

Rather, I wonder why we were so convinced that we had to answer those concerns on the spot?

Now that I think about it, there is no way we would have been recording without reading through the content first.

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. It seems that we were both too hasty. We were convinced that we would have to be answering those concerns on the spot.

…… But I hope that by preparing the answers in advance, we can approach the actual day with ease of mind.

**Adonis**: Still, there are so many. I didn’t realize that everyone has such a large amount of concerns.

Is there any concern that got your attention, Ran-senpai?

**Nagisa**: …… There’s one that says ”I accidentally ate too many sweets. Please tell me the ways to avoid getting fat.”

**Adonis**: ……? Isn’t it fine if they just exercise?

**Nagisa**: …… I think so too. The solution is obvious. However, I’m wondering why they don’t do that.

…… Maybe there’s some sort of special reason that prevents them from exercising.

**Adonis**: …… If that’s the case, it would be difficult for me to give them advice.

Anyone can move their bodies. If they can’t, I can only assume that it must have something to do with circumstances out of their control.

**Nagisa**: …… Did you find an interesting concern, Adonis-kun?

**Adonis**: Yes. I think the concern “English is so difficult that I ended up getting bad marks on my tests. Are there any good ways to study?” is interesting.

I really understand that learning languages is difficult. Even now I’m still uneasy about whether or not I’m understanding Japanese properly.

**Nagisa**: …… But your Japanese is quite good. I can see that you’ve studied.

**Adonis**: I just naturally picked it up since I have been going back and forth between Japan and my home country since I was little.

But still, I worked hard to learn Japanese. In the end, I can’t say anything except that honestly studying will bear fruit.

Is it fine to bring up this concern in the show?

**Nagisa**: …… I wonder. At the very least, it might be lacking in excitement. We can only point out the obvious, huh.

**Adonis**: That’s right. I’m kind of not convinced that this can lead to those concerns being resolved properly.

**Nagisa**: …… Let’s look at the other concerns. There are so many other ones.

…… Let’s calmly look for concerns that even we can solve.

(A few hours later)

**Adonis**: …… How is it, Ran-senpai? Did you find any concerns that look like something we can solve?

**Nagisa**: …… I don’t know. “To choose” or rather, not knowing which one is the correct choice is difficult.

**Adonis**: Is that so? I can’t seem to find a concern that I’d be able to solve either.

Actually, is there even a concern that we can solve within these concerns……

**Nagisa**: …… It could be that thinking that we could solve them is arrogant in its own way.

**Adonis**: What do you mean by that?

**Nagisa**: …… I thought about it a little. All the concerns piled up here must be serious concerns for the people who sent them in.

…… We’re at a position to choose between these serious concerns, the ones that we think we could solve.

…… Just like the arrogant act of choosing who to save. Are we really equipped with the capacity to do something like that?

**Adonis**: It’s just like what you said, Ran-senpai. By all means, I guess we should be trying to answer every concern compiled here……

Hm? It seems someone’s knocking on the door.

**Kaoru**: That’s great. It seems you’re here. Hi, Adonis-kun, Ran-kun. Is your meeting going well?

**Adonis**: Hakaze-senpai!? Why are you here……?

**Kaoru**: I was with Anzu-chan up ‘til a little while ago. We were working at the same location today.

Since I left early, she asked me to come see how the two of you are doing if I had the time.

I was the one who recommended Adonis-kun to be my substitute this time, after all. In the dorms, I heard from Ran-kun that you were having a hard time, so I thought I could lend you some help.

**Nagisa**: …… Thank you. You would be a real help, Kaoru-kun. Actually, right now–

(A few minutes later)

**Kaoru**: Ahaha, you two are really serious people. I can’t believe it turned into such a magnificent story……

If you dwell on it that much, no matter how much time passes, it won’t be enough, you see?

**Nagisa**: …… As you said, time is limited. Besides, thinking that we would be able to answer all the concerns is the true arrogance.

**Adonis**: …… That’s true. That’s why we have a responsibility to choose the things that we can solve.

**Kaoru**: So strict! Well, I guess that sort of seriousness and single-mindedness is a good trait for the both of you.

Okay. For now, let’s stop thinking about it in the “We have to solve it by all means” way.

**Nagisa**: …… Why is that? I think it’s important to solve the concerns since they’re asking for advice.

**Kaoru**: Still, in the end what we can do in the TV show is just to give advice. We won’t be able to know they get resolved, right?

**Adonis**: …… It’s definitely as you said.

**Kaoru**: That’s why the important thing is for you two to find a concern that you can relate to.

**Adonis**: A concern that we can relate to……

**Kaoru**: For example, if it was me, I’d pick this one. A love-related concern. “There is someone I’m interested in. How should I try to talk to them?”

The sort of feeling that when they see them, they want to cheer them on. Well, it’ll be a problem too if that’s all they do.

The important thing here is for you to be able to chat about it.

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Yorishiro/0fnadlq3.png">

**Nagisa**: …… Basically, it’s fine to find something that the two of us can easily talk about?

**Kaoru**: If we’re being straight to the point, that’s it. Did you find some suitable concerns?

**Nagisa**: …… Mm. I think this one is good. I think it should be easy to talk to Adonis-kun about.

**Adonis**: Indeed. If it’s this, I might have something to talk about too.

Thank you. Thanks to your advice, Hakaze-senpai, it feels like we’ve moved a step forward.

**Nagisa**: …… Kaoru-kun is good at giving people advice, I see.

**Kaoru**: That wasn’t what I was trying to do though. Anyway, I’m glad to be able to do something for the two of you.

# Trouble Talking Six

(Location: Simple Studio)

(A few days later. On the day of the TV show recording.)

**Nagisa**: “…… Good evening to everyone in front of the TV. This TV program is a program where two currently active idols will talk and give advice on the viewers’ concerns.

…… This time, the ones acting as MC’s for this program will be me, Eden’s Ran Nagisa and—”

**Adonis**: “Otogari Adonis from UNDEAD. I’ll be counting on your best regards.

Without further delay, let’s read the first viewer’s concerns right away.”

**Nagisa**: “…… Fufu, it really is sudden. In variety shows, we usually have a narration part before that. Is this okay?”

**Adonis**: “I’m sorry. I might have been too hasty.”

**Nagisa**: “…… No, don’t worry about it. We’ve really accumulated a lot of concerns here after all.

…… Once again; to everyone in front of the television, thank you for thinking of asking us for advice.”

**Adonis**: “Even though we were surprised at the amount of letters we received, we’ve looked over everything.

We wanted to respond to the feelings in each and every one of the letters we have received with all our ability since every single one was especially sent to us

Due to the time constraints of the TV show itself, we’re sorry that we couldn’t respond to every concern.

And that is why we want to discuss the concerns we’ve picked out seriously. We don’t know if we could resolve these issues or not, but we would be happy if it could be of help. ”

**Nagisa**: “…… Now then once again, let’s spare no time in reading the first one.

…… Due to circumstances on my parents’ side, I had to move away from the town I’ve been living in up till around fall of last year.

…… Even though I’ve transferred to a new high school, I still can’t make any friends.

…… I think it’s because while there was someone who tried to talk to me, I could only respond awkwardly to them.

…… How do I become better at conversations?

…… It seems like a problem with not being able to talk to people well.”

**Adonis**: “When we found out about this concern, we both worried over whether we would be able to solve this issue properly or not.”

**Nagisa**: “…… That’s right. The truth is, the both of us here are not good at conversations either. I wonder if that’s surprising?”

**Adonis**: “Even when it was decided that we were going to appear in this show, we were worried if we could be proper MC’s for the show.

This TV program just started, but I wonder if we’re doing well as MC’s?”

**Nagisa**: “…… Fufu. Adonis-kun, that sounds like we’re the ones asking for advice. Right now, we’re supposed to be addressing the viewers’ concerns.”

**Adonis**: “My apologies. This conversation unintentionally ended up being about us.

Still, moving away, huh? Being in a new place makes you anxious. I understand that well.”

Nagsia: “…… Come to think about it, Adonis-kun also came to Japan from overseas, right?”

**Adonis**: “The change in my surroundings to an unfamiliar one was disheartening.

There was also the part where I was worried about my Japanese. I wasn’t quite able to fit in.

That is why I’m very grateful to everyone in UNDEAD who has steadily accepted me and listened to me.

It’ll be nice if the person who sent in this concern has people like that around them too.”

**Nagisa**: “…… I agree. But it’s pretty difficult to take that first step if you’re not good at conversations.

…… I can glean from reading the letter that even though the person who wrote it is not good at talking, they really want to.

…… Could the truth be that they’re just not a very chatty person? Because the letter can convey their feelings to us without any problems.”

**Adonis**: “It’s as you’ve said. It doesn’t have the impression of someone unable to make conversation.”

**Nagisa**: “…… That’s why I think there is no other way but to muster up courage to speak up, even if it sounds a little harsh on my end.

…… Your letter also mentioned that there is someone there who is trying to talk to you.

…… Try to change your perspective. Maybe the person who tried to talk to you also had to muster up their whole courage to try to talk to you.

…… If you think about it that way, that person must sound like a very gentle person, doesn’t it?”

**Adonis**: “That’s right. Even if there is someone there to offer their hand to you, you yourself must have the courage to take it.

”It might be scary, but how about you try to be the one to start up a conversation next time?” is a way.

I believe that if that person is a kind person, they will definitely take your hand in response.”

**Nagisa**: “…… We’ll be cheering you on too. If it doesn’t work, please come back and send us another letter.

…… Since we share the same problem in not being good at conversations, we’ll talk with you as many times as you need. ”

(Location: Starmony Dorms Common Room)

(A few days after recording. At Starmony Dorms.)

**Hiyori**: I finally get time to relax with Nagisa-kun♪

Come on, Nagisa-kun, you can talk to me to your heart’s content♪ First, we could have lunch……

**Adonis**: Ran-senpai, here you are. I’ve been looking for you.

**Hiyori**: Seriously! What are you doing interrupting my chat with Nagisa-kun, Adonis-kun?

**Adonis**: Mm? If I’m interrupting, I apologise. It’s just that I have something I want to tell Ran-senpai right now.

**Nagisa**: …… You want to tell me something? What could it be?

**Adonis**: A few days ago, the TV program for consultation of concerns recording that Ran-senpai and I were in together was broadcasted.

That program got great ratings and we’ve received a fan letter for it.

I’ve received it from Anzu this morning, and wanted to show it to you too, Ran-senpai.

**Nagisa**: …… Is that so? Did you read it first, Adonis-kun?

**Adonis**: I’m sorry. I meant for us to read it together, but I got curious.

**Nagisa**: …… It’s okay, you don’t have to apologise. I would have read it too, if I was in your position.

…… Oh? Could the sender of this letter be?

**Adonis**: It’s from the little one who was worried about not being able to make any friends.

Watching the TV program gave them courage. And then, they were able to make a friend properly.

**Nagisa**: …… Watching us talk eagerly about it gave them the courage, I see.

**Adonis**: I’m really happy to think that even someone like me can be helpful to someone.

**Nagisa**: …… Mm. I feel happy that we too had the courage to answer those concerns.

**Hiyori**: Yes yes. As expected of Nagisa-kun. I’m proud of you too♪

**Nagisa**: …… The truth is, I was a little self-conscious of how Hiyori-kun would respond.

**Hiyori**: Nn? What do you mean by me?

**Nagisa**: …… Because the first person to be offered this TV program was Hiyori-kun.

…… So I was conscious of the image of Hiyori-kun, who had taught me a lot of things.

…… I don’t think I was able to do everything well, but did I fulfill my duty as your substitute, Hiyori-kun?

**Hiyori**: Of course you did it perfectly! That fan letter is proof of that!

**Adonis**: Tomoe-senpai’s substitute, huh? I wonder if I was able to be a worthy replacement for Hakaze-senpai too……

**Nagisa**: …… That, too, is eloquently conveyed in this fan-letter isn’t it?

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Yorishiro/ktkdznkd.png">

**Adonis**: …… That’s true. Even though they said they were bad at conversation, it’s enough to make me suspect that they were actually good at it.

I’m glad I took on this job. I think I gained a little confidence for talk shows.

I’ve been obliged to you too, Ran-senpai. Thank you.

**Nagisa**: …… Adonis-kun helped me out a lot too. Thank you.

…… By the way, are you hungry?

**Adonis**: Mm? Now that you mention it, it’s almost lunch time.

**Nagisa**: …… If you’d like, how about eating lunch with us?

**Adonis**: I’m off work in the afternoon so I don’t mind, but is Tomoe-senpai okay with this?

**Hiyori**: Because it’s proposed by Nagisa-kun and nobody else, I have no complaints either.

Besides, we need to reward the two of you who worked hard! We have to do a proper wrap party!

**Adonis**: A wrap party, huh. Come to think of it, we haven’t done one yet.

**Nagisa**: …… That’s because I didn’t get much of a chance to meet Adonis-kun after the recording ended.

…… Since it’s been a while, I want to have a chat with you.

**Adonis**: Coincidentally, I was just thinking the same thing.

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu, in that case, we’ll all enjoy chatting together to our heart’s content today♪. We have lots of time, after all.
