(Location: CosPro Conference Area)

**Ibara**: ………

This is probably the best time to contact the other party. Even though the other person is of higher rank, I don’t like humbling myself too much and being criticized.

Now, what’s the next matter I have to work on? Oh? What on Earth is this stack of paper?

…… Ah, is that the photogravure gallery of Eden I took the other day? Hmm…… At first glance it looks like there’s no issues. (1)

Well, I think it’d be better to check in with each person.

His Highness is particularly sensitive about his appearance, especially when it comes to visuals. I’ll check with him to be sure—

Hm? An electronic sound coming from my tablet……?

(Ah. Is it that alarm that sounds when the stock price fluctuates?)

Uum……?

Huh? What on Earth is this……?

(The price of the stock I bought the other day plummeted……?

It’s common for stocks to fluctuate when investing, but I had read that this stock was pretty solid……)

…… Did I read it completely wrong? What a shame…… I ended up paying for an expensive life lesson.

<img src="/images/SecondEra/PrivateRoom/p8lvm83w.png">

(Location: Starmony Dorms (Exterior - Night))

**Ibara**: Fuu…… (Turning his head to relieve his stiffness)

(I’m tired…… No matter how many things I settle and finish, the work just keeps coming one after another. Today was a really busy day.

I found out I double-booked a shoot, was unable to get a hold of the other party, and was told they lost the documents I had gone through great lengths to create.

To top it all off, how on Earth did I only discover this evening that there was an unprocessed matter due today……!

Even though things went well in the morning without any major trouble……

—That’s right. It was around the time the stock price fell. Problems kept occurring in tandem.)

Haah. I’m not lucky at all…… Oh?

**Natsume**: Hm?

**Ibara**: Ah, hello. Are you heading out at this hour? Thank you for your hard work.

**Natsume**: I was just trying to go to the nearby convenience stoRE— More importantly. Fuuun…… HeEH?

**Ibara**: …… What is it? I’d like you to stop staring at me so intensely. 

**Natsume**: I sense you weren’t feeling very ambitious toDAY. What’s wrong with your conditiON?

**Ibara**: Huh……?

**Natsume**: It feels like you’ve been constantly exposed to the negative energy of a malevolent stAR. You’re down on your luCK. It’s a pretty rare conditiON, Ibara-kun. 

**Ibara**: What? It’s true that there were quite a few incidents today but I didn’t think there were that many.

Well, I suppose today just happened to be that kind of day. Statistically speaking, it’s normal to have bad days even if you’re lucky.

**Natsume**: That’s riGHT. It’s normal to have good days and bad dAYS. But your situation is differeNT. As I saID, you’ve faltered.

Sometimes it’s no exaggeration to say that there are people possessed by malevolent spirITS. That’s exactly what your condition is nOW.

It’s rare to come across such a caSE. How about it? I’ll tell you your fortUNE.

Honestly, I don’t care about you, but your condition is interesting because of your jOB.

**Ibara**: No, that’s quite fine. I don’t wish to hear such troublesome talk. I don’t believe in any of that spiritual stuff.

To begin with, if all fortune-telling was correct, then no gambling would take place and no one would fail in their investments.

**Natsume**: You don’t understAND. Fortune telling is not predictiON. General fortune telling is based on “observation” and “deductION.”

There are fortune tellers who claim to be 100% accurate, but they’re not fortune tellERS. They’re swindlERS.

Well, think about what I’m about to say as just small tALK. All I’m saying is that you can make the ingredients into whatever dish you want them to BE.

**Ibara**: Good grief. Well, I’m fine. I’m not interested at all, but I decided that it would be more reasonable to just listen rather than have a debate here.

So could you please hurry up and finish your fortune telling quickly?

**Natsume**: AlriGHT. I sometimes get asked to read fortunes by people I meet for work, so I usually keep this with ME. It all worked oUT.

**Ibara**: What did you just pull out? A pendant?

**Natsume**: No. This is a penduLUM—Hmhmmm…… I see. As expected, the rotation of the stars has worseNED.

**Ibara**: Even though you were talking to me in an insinuating manner, you were being very casual. What could you possibly understand about me at that level?

**Natsume**: I’m not trying to get into technical matters here, but taking more time doesn’t necessarily improve accurACY.

That’s right…… Maybe you could turn your luck around by reclaiming something familIAR.

**Ibara**: What? Even if you say that……

**Natsume**: Whether or not you believe it is up to you, Ibara-KUN. Like I said, just think of it as small tALK. Well, keep it in the back of your mIND. Then, I’ll be OFF.

**Ibara**: …… Good grief. I would like you to say what you want to say and not leave immediately……

TL NOTES:
<ol> 
<li>A photogravure is an intaglio print process that was sometimes used to produce high-quality reproductions of photographs in ink. Traditionally it involves a copper plate being etched and then coated with light-sensitive gelatin that was exposed to a film positive. Fancy black and white photos. This instance was more than likely the digital version of the technique, which involves the masking and printing of various light values that have been etched, building up its values over time.</li>

(Location: CosPro Conference Area)

(One week later)

**Ibara**: —Yes, yes. I believe I explained that many times the other day, right? I’ll send you the materials via email.

That’s right. I’ll contact that person from here.

No. Everyone makes mistakes, so please be careful in the future. Yes, yes. Thank you. Then, please excuse me.

Haah…… Is it an email this time? Uumm……?

—Ahh, come on! What the hell is going on with this situation……!

Problems occur here and there every day! Even when I fix one problem, two more problems pop up in different places at the same time!

This is nothing short of abnormal!

Another email? Yes, yes. What happened this time?

…… What? ‘My working hours have increased too much this month, so why don’t I take some time off somewhere?’ What are they talking about……?

It’s true that I’ve been busy this month due to filming and management duties, and for the past week or so I’ve been working overtime all the time in order to deal with problems.

…… However, there’s no way I could honestly take a day off in this current situation. This is a person who doesn’t know the situation, so……

(No…… Wait. It’s certainly not the time to take a long break.

Recently, the real situation of major agencies with black labor systems has been a hot topic…… (1)

The public will be looking for the next sacrificial company to pop up in the news in a chain reaction.

Under such circumstances, it would be too risky for me to collapse from overwork as the deputy director……)

Damn…… I have no choice. I’ll quickly finish my day off tomorrow and return to the front line as soon as possible.

(Location: Starmony Dorms (Exterior))

**Aira**: Uummm…… Copy and paste the inquiry number here. All I have to do is start the inquiry~

—The status is complete! It’s almost arrived! My oshi’s national tour disc♪

What a reli~ef. I thought it would arrive later. I have plenty of time before I go to bed, so I’m gonna enjoy this to the fu~llest today.

That’s why I bought a lot of sweets and drinks. I won’t be leaving my room after today……!

**Nazuna**: O~i, Aira-chin. Isn’t it dangerous to walk while looking at your phone~?

**Aira**: Ah, Nito-senpai! Sorry. I couldn’t help but wonder if my package had arrived. Ehehee.

**Nazuna**: Package? Oh, were you tracking your courier package?

I understand why you’re worried about its status, but it’s still dangerous. By the way, what kind of package are you getting?

**Aira**: It’s the national tour disc for my favorite idol! I’ve been looking forward to its release!

Right now, my roommates Sakuma-senpai and Tenshouin-senpai are away at a long-term location shoot.

So even if I make noise, I won’t bother anyone, and I think I’ll have a good time at my solo viewing party.

I’m planning to go back to my room and start right away— hm?

Huh? Is there some kind of contractor at the dorms right now?

It looks like there are long pipes being brought in and large trucks going in and out. Outsiders also seem to be wandering around? Is there something going on?

**Nazuna**: Ahh…… Come to think of it, I heard that there was a problem with the water pipes on our floor and that the repair work begins today.

**Aira**: Ehh!? Construction!?

Th-This can’t be happening~…… Even though I just wanted to enjoy my disc quietly today~……

**Nazuna**: Ah. But from what I heard, the construction work will be done in the morning. Aren’t they just doing the demolition work now?

So I think we can have some quiet time after this~

**Aira**: Wh- that’s good news……♪ Then I don’t have to worry! See ya, Nito-senpai. I’m gonna pick up my luggage right away!

**Nazuna**: Alright, have fun. Bye~♪

<img src="/images/SecondEra/PrivateRoom/7ogg366o.png">

(Location: Starmony Dorm Room (Eichi, Rei, Aira’s Room))

**Aira**: I’m back~☆

– Even though I said that, Sakuma-senpai and Tenshouin-senpai are away for a few days due to long-term location work so there’s no way I’d get a reply.

In the end, I feel a little lonely without my seniors……

Well, it can’t be helped. It’s work. And that’s why I can watch discs without hesitation.

Ah, that’s right! I have to open the package right away! I have to be careful not to damage the package inside……

Uwaai♪ As expected of the first limited edition! There’s lots of bonuses!

Arrange the goods and discs neatly~. Take a photo! Alright! I’ll upload it to SNS later♪

Then, let’s finally have the viewing party for today’s main event—

Hmm? My face feels a little sticky. Maybe there’s still some foundation left over from work this morning……?

It’s hard to lie down in bed like this. I’ll wash my face before the viewing party.

Once I start watching it, I don’t want to be distracted by anything else. I have to be fully prepared!

…… Huhh? Even though I’ve turned the faucet all the way, the water isn’t coming out…… Isn’t that weird?

It was normal until this morning. It doesn’t look like there’s anything particularly wrong with the lower pipe.

Could it be that the water in the room is off because they’re doing repair work on the water system……?

Ehh? That’s a problem~……! I just wanted to wash my face and have a watch party.

Get the water flowing! Hey, hey!

—Eh!? The handle of the faucet came off!? UWAWAWAWAWAWA!? THE WATER’S GUSHING OU~T!?

W-Wait a minute! Can someone please stop thiiiiiiiiis!?

<br>

# Chapter Three

<img src="/images/SecondEra/PrivateRoom/5yloyy4o.png">

(Location: Starmony Dorms Hallway (2F))

**Mitsuru**: Bread bread, br-br-br-brea\~d♪ Delicious freshly baked bread\~

It’s so plump and chewy because it wants to be eaten by me\~♪ Bread bread, br-br-br-brea\~d♪

**Midori**: What’s with that song? It’s somehow stuck in my head, so please stop……

Anyway, it’s just as I’d suspected from a bakery recommended by Tenma-kun. All the bread looked delicious, and before I knew it I ended up buying too much.

Thank you for taking me there. I had been thinking of going to the convenience store because I was hungry.

**Mitsuru**: That’s a cheap thing to buy! I mean, is that all Midori-chan needs to eat? That won’t fill your stomach, right~?

**Midori**: Yeah……? Three loaves of bread is a bit more than normal, isn’t it?

In fact, I think Tenma-kun is eating too much…… Can you really eat all of that big bag of bread?

**Mitsuru**: Fufun♪ That’s how much time I have! I’ll make sure to finish eating by dinner time.

**Midori**: Ehh!? Are you planning to eat all that in one day— hm?

**Aira**: ………

**Midori**: UwaaAAA!? There’s a ghooost!?

**Mitsuru**: Midori-chan, Midori-chan. It’s not a ghost, it’s Ai-chan.

**Midori**: —Eh, Shiratori-kun?

…… Ahh, that’s right. If you look closely it is Shiratori-kun. Why’s he crouching down at the end of the hallway like that?

**Mitsuru**: Ai-chan, are you okay? Does your stomach hurt?

**Aira**: Hueh……? H-Huh? Tenma-senpai and Takamine-senpai? Ah, I see. This is the second floor.

Umm, I’m fine. It’s not like my stomach hurts or that I’m injured. That’s not the full truth though……

**Mitsuru**: Hm? Did something happen? We’ll listen to what you have to say, alright?

**Aira**: Uuu. Thank you very much……! Actually—

**Midori**: Ehh!? The water supply broke?

**Mitsuru**: That’s a bi~g deal!

**Aira**: That’s right. I had the water turned off, but the room was a mess.

**Midori**: Uwaa…… That was rough, wasn’t it. If I were in that situation it’d make me want to die……

Uum, I understand that there was some trouble. But why were you crouching down like that……?

**Aira**: Ah, about that. I was worried that it might have leaked to the floor below, so I went to check it out. In the end, it didn’t leak, so that was a relief.

They said it’ll take three days to repair and clean the room and that the room would be completely unusable in that time.

When I was at a loss for what to do next, I lost the will to move……

Before I knew it, Takamine-senpai and Tenma-senpai were right in front of me.

**Mitsuru**: Uu\~. I feel so bad for Ai-chan\~……

…… Ah! That’s it! You should come to our room! Ao-chan-senpai is also away for work so there’s free space in the room!

**Aira**: Aoba-senpai too? Ah, now that I think about it… Sakuma-senpai and Tenshouin-senpai said that Aoba-senpai would be going with them……

But even so, I’d feel bad to burden you guys for three days.

There’s also Saegusa-senpai in the room with you guys. I’ll figure something out on my own.

**Mitsuru**: But that’s not fair, is it? The other day, Sou-chan-senpai taught Ado-chan-senpai and I the phrase “If you know what’s right and don’t do it, then you have no courage.”

I’ll put it into practice too!

It’s alright. Saegusa-chan-senpai will understand if you explain the situation properly! Hey, Midori-chan. You think so too, right?

**Midori**: Eh? Are you asking me……?

U~mm…… I don’t know if it’s okay to call that without asking permission……

Still, it would be a shame to turn a blind eye to a situation like this……

Besides, Shiratori-kun is also my club junior. I think it would be fine for just three days……?

**Aira**: Uu…… Takamine-senpai, Tenma-senpai, thank you so much……! I’ll never forget this kindness!

**Mitsuru**: Ahaha. It’s no big deal~

C’mon, c’mon! I bought lots of delicious bread, so let’s go back to the room and eat together☆

<img src="/images/SecondEra/PrivateRoom/tmcqnww7.png">

(Location: Starmony Dorms (Exterior - Night))

**Ibara**: Fuu……

(I managed to get all of my work done before I went on my day off. I’m sure it’ll pile up again tomorrow in the meantime.

Well, that’s fine. It may be an unexpected day off, but I haven’t been able to take much time for myself lately regardless.

Moreover, Takamine-shi and Tenma-shi are supposed to be working tomorrow…… It’ll be nice to be able to spend time alone in my room.

How should I spend my first vacation in quite some time?)

<img src="/images/SecondEra/PrivateRoom/r07njh1i.png">

(Location: Starmony Dorm Room (Ibara, Mitsuru, Midori, Tsumugi’s Room))

**Ibara**: ………

**Mitsuru and Midori**: Welcome ba~ck.

**Aira**: W-Welcome back.

**Ibara**: …… Why is Shiratori-shi here?

**Mitsuru**: That’s because we picked him up~!

**Ibara**: …… Is that so? So, can he go back to where he came from right now?

**Midori**: Awawa…… It’s like we picked up an abandoned cat!? W-Wait please! That’s not how it is. There’s a good reason for this……!

**Ibara**: And that is?

—In other words, you want him to stay here until his room becomes available again……

**Mitsuru**: That’s right~. Ai-chan is really in trouble and I feel bad for him. So it’s fine, right, Saegusa-senpai?

**Ibara**: (Good grief. I was planning to spend some time alone tomorrow. I didn’t expect to be denied like this.

Seriously. There’s a limit to how good-natured you can be. Why do you go out of your way to pick up trouble like this……

It’s not my fault, so I should leave it to the dormitory manager.

I’m sorry Shiratori-shi, but I’ll have to ask you to leave. I’m not fond of things like taking on responsibilities I don’t need to.)

**Aira**: Umm…… It’s a bother after all, isn’t it?

**Ibara**: ………

(No. Wait……? I think they were in the same room as Shiratori-shi—)

Not at all. When we’re in trouble, we call on each other! There’s plenty of empty space.

Until your room is ready, you may feel free to spend your time in this room as if it were your own☆

**Aira**: ! T-Thank you very much!

**Ibara**: (By selling a favor to Shiratori-shi, I’m also indirectly selling a favor to His Holiness Eichi and Sakuma-shi. This is what it means to kill two birds with one stone! Ahaha☆)

# Chapter Four

<img src="/images/SecondEra/PrivateRoom/pa8yuaka.png">

(Location: Starmony Dorm Room (Ibara, Mitsuru, Midori, Tsumugi’s Room))

**Aira**: Fuah, Aaaa…….. Good morning.

**Ibara**: Good morning.

Takamine-shi and Tenma-shi are both working today. I heard that they’ll be returning in the middle of the night.

Please feel free to spend time in this room as if it was your own. Though, it might be a bit difficult for you to be here with me, just the two of us. 

**Aira**: No no! That’s not the case at all……!

To be honest, it’s more like I’m the freeloader here. You should be the one carrying on without caring too much about me, Saegusa-senpai.

I’ll take up your offer on doing whatever I’d like in here too.

**Ibara**: Thank you very much. That’s what I’ll do.

**Aira**: (……And so I said, but being together with Saegusa-senpai, just the two of us is making me nervous……!)

This reminds me of when I first found out about dorming with Sakuma-senpai and Tenshouin-senpai. I was really nervous at that time too.

I’m curious about Saegusa-senpai’s day off……♪

Since Saegusa-senpai has the image of a workaholic.

Even though he revealed how he spends his days off in Eden’s interview article, it felt like it was just a safe response.

That’s why Saegusa-senpai’s private life is still a mystery.

Besides, I just can’t help being curious about the way idols in highly popular units spend their days off!)

**Ibara**: …… (Doing some reading)

**Aira**: (I see, I see. Heh……Saegusa-senpai likes to read. I wonder what book he’s reading?

If it’s a book I’m familiar with, maybe it could help broaden the topic of conversation.

Let’s see……”Working techniques to keep a step ahead”?

……Eh, what’s that? A business book, huh? That suits Saegusa-senpai well, but if that’s the case I won’t know about it.)

**Ibara**: ……… (Using his tablet)

**Aira**: (Mm? He stopped reading the book in his hand and started looking at his tablet.

I get it~ I do that a lot too. When I’m in the middle of watching TV or a movie in my room, somehow my hand would end up touching my smartphone.

He looks so serious…… I wonder what he’s looking at?

But I know more about the internet than about books, so it might be easier to find a common interest to talk about! Since this is Saegusa-senpai, maybe he’s looking up news on the internet?

Whaat? It doesn’t look like he’s looking up news.There seems to be a lot of graphs. It’s got to be stocks then?

I usually have no affinity to them, so I barely look at them.

Ah~ stocks, huh? The stocks don’t seem like a topic that we can talk about together……A shame.)

<img src="/images/SecondEra/PrivateRoom/i77xfliz.png">

**Aira**: (Ah, he’s back to reading again.

In that interview article I read back then……I thought he had just given a safe response.

It could be that the truth is not that he was making up the answers for the public, but he just answered as they really are.)

**Ibara**: ………

…… Could you please not stare so much? It’s quite uncomfortable.

**Aira**: Uhyaah! Y-you noticed!?

**Ibara**: You’ve been observing and scrutinizing me that much. I’m not that dull. If anything, I think it’s strange that you think you’ve been able to hide it.

**Aira**: I’m sorry~ It’s just that I thought I was going to get a glimpse of the surprising side of Saegusa-senpai’s private life, but it’s unexpectedly normal.

**Ibara**: I’m sorry for being an uninteresting person.

**Aira**: Eh!? No  no!! That’s not what I meant!

I just mean that reading business books and looking at stocks isn’t that much different from what you usually do.

**Ibara**: But I do a lot of different other things at my usual job. I just thought I should spend my day off working on something beneficial.

**Aira**: Hm~mm. Now that you’ve mentioned it, in a broader sense, my own hobbies might be similar. My idol otaku knowledge could be used in certain places in my idol activities too.

Alri~ght. Then I’ll spend some time watching videos of my favourite idols……♪ I need to prepare warm tea and snacks to go with my videos!

Ah, I’ll brew some tea for you too, Saegusa-senpai.

**Ibara**: No, please don’t mind me.

**Aira**: Don’t be that way. I’ve troubled you so much. If I don’t do anything to make up for it, I won’t be able to calm down. So please don’t hesitate in accepting.

**Ibara**: Haa, well. In that case, I’ll be counting on you. If I remember correctly, the tea leaves are kept above that cupboard.

**Aira**: Got it. Please wait a moment.

On top of the cupboard……Ye~p—

( Uu……Even on my tip toes, I can’t reach it.

It’ll be so pathetic if I ask Saegusa-senpai for help because I suddenly couldn’t reach the tea leaves. After all that fuss I’ve made about it too.)

Mm?

(Ah, There’s a small stepping stool here. The seat has a mascot character on it, how cute~ That’s perfect, I’ll borrow this. Heave ho—)

Heh!? It sounds like there was a snap coming from the stool……?

Uwaaaaa!? I’m falling……!?

# Chapter Five

<img src="/images/SecondEra/PrivateRoom/2qjq7x7x.png">

(Location: Starmony Dorm Room (Ibara, Mitsuru, Midori, Tsumugi’s Room))

**Aira**: Ow ow ow…… What happened?

—Ah, the stepping stool’s legs broke. So the sound I heard from before was the legs snapping?

**Ibara**: Shiratori-shi, are you alright? I heard a loud sound.

**Aira**: Ah, while I was using the stepping stool, it’s legs……

**Ibara**: I see. So you’ve used that stepping stool. That stepping stool belongs to Takemine-shi, but it seems that the legs were broken.

Even though it could no longer be used, he kept it because it’s something you can’t get anymore.

**Aira**: Eh, it’s something really important, then? What should I do? Even though I didn’t know, I still destroyed something important……

**Ibara**: It’s not like you destroyed it. It was already broken in the first place.

**Aira**: Even so, that’s not the problem. If you could not buy this from stores anymore, I wonder if there is anyone selling it on flea market apps? 

…… It’s no use. Nobody is selling. I didn’t expect it to be so rare that even second-hand items were in short supply.

What to do. I don’t want to just apologise, I want to compensate him.

Haa. Today was the same as yesterday. I wonder why I keep breaking the things around me? How unlucky……

**Ibara**: (‘Unlucky’, he said. The same thing’s been happening to me a lot lately. Though it’s not like I feel empty enough to feel a kinship with someone due to having bad luck.)

…… If you can’t buy it, let’s just make it.

**Aira**: Huh……?

<img src="/images/SecondEra/PrivateRoom/d2px71vz.png">

(Location: Starmony Dorms Courtyard)

**Aira**: Saegusa-senpai! I’ve compiled all the materials you asked for. What now?

**Ibara**: Yes, leave them over there.

<img src="/images/SecondEra/PrivateRoom/3et0vlks.png">

**Ibara**: Next, measure each part to their correct size and mark them. Then we just have to cut along the mark.

**Aira**: Fuha…. By ‘make’, you really meant making it by hand.

**Ibara**: What else would it mean?

**Aira**: Ehehe, thank you very much for lending me a hand.

Still, Saegusa-senpai does things like this huh? I thought you would be the type of person to buy new things when the old ones get broken. It’s surprising.

**Ibara**: Usually I’ll just buy them. In the first place, there is nothing wrong with buying new things to replace old things.

There are people who think that cherishing a singular item so it could be used for a long time is a virtue, but it doesn’t suit me.

To begin with, why is using money always a minus against someone’s image?

**Aira**: Hm~mm. Now that you mention it… I’m happier saving money than spending it. It feels like something commendable.

**Ibara**: Purchasing things drives the economy to function. Circulation of money is how a proper society works.  

It’s ridiculous to simplify spending as needless consumption or wasteful extravagance. When you purchase things, you’re compensating the professionals for their skills and techniques.

In other words, it also comes with the connotation of showing respect.

**Aira**: I see……! If I think about it that way, splurging on my oshi’s is actually going to feel like a noble thing!

There have been times when I feel discouraged and it gets hard because I don’t have enough money, but from now on I feel like I’ll be able to face that situation positively♪

**Ibara**: It’s fine to advocate for a good cause, but please be careful as wasteful spending beyond your means is just foolish.

**Aira**: Ugh…… Yes, I’ll be careful.

Eh? In that case, Saegusa-senpai is usually the type to want to buy things, and not make them right?

Well, even if we feel like buying it, it’s no longer being sold anywhere so it can’t be helped.

**Ibara**: Yes, and in this case you could say that each has its own value. I think this is not an example that can be applied to what I’ve just said.

**Aira**: Each has its own value? What does that mean?

**Ibara**: It’s value in function. It’s value as a character merchandise. As well as the value of each material and part that make up the stepping stool.

The reason Takamine-shi liked this character stepping stool was not because it’s a stepping stool.

It’s not like he particularly liked the materials used here either. My guess is that the printing on the seat plays a large role in this.

Otherwise, he would have disposed of it once it was no longer usable.

**Aira**: Mmhm. I think so too.

I do think things like logos are cute, but I think anything with a large print of an idol on it is special in and of itself.

**Ibara**: In that case, we should make the most of this printing. At the very least, we should protect the lines that Takamine-shi wants.

It can’t be helped that it’s broken now, but this way we should be able to decrease Takamine-shi’s disappointment to some degree.

**Aira**: Uu….. For someone like me. Saegusa-senpai, thank you very much…….! 

**Ibara**: Yes, yes. I’ve been accepting your thanks from earlier on and it’s enough. Don’t just talk, please move your hands.

We have to finish building this before Takamine-shi returns.

**Aira**: Ah, yeees! I’ll try my best to help!

# Chapter Six

(Location: Starmony Dorms Courtyard (Evening))

**Aira**: We did it! It’s been safely completed~♪

You’re amazing, Saegusa-senpai! It looks even cuter and nicer than before it was broken, it even looks brand new! Takamine-senpai would be so happy with this.

**Ibara**: My my, it’s fortunate that we somehow managed to do it with materials we could find in the dorm.

**Aira**: All things considered, Saegusa-senpai is so handy. You made this in no time, too. Do you like DIY?

**Ibara**: It’s not like I like DIY in particular. I spent a long period of time in a place with no entertainment or shops, so I just ended up being able to do it out of necessity.

**Aira**: Oh. Is that so, that sounds kind of awful…

**Ibara**: Come on, all we need to do is give it to Takamine-shi back in the dorm room. Let’s go back.

(Location: Starmony Dorm Room (Ibara, Mitsuru, Midori, Tsumugi’s Room))

**Midori**: I’m back……

**Mitsuru**: I’m back~!

**Aira**: Ah, Takamine-senpai, Tenma-senpai. Welcome back—

Also…… Takamine-senpai, I’m sorry!

**Midori**: Eh. W-what? Getting apologised to when I just got back is too scary……!

**Aira**: The truth is, I borrowed Takamine-senpai’s stepping stool and broke it……

**Midori**: Stepping stool? The one with the mascot character on it? Why again?

**Ibara**: It seems that he used it since it was right next to him when he was trying to reach for the tea leaves.

**Aira**: That’s right. After that, Saegusa-senpai and I rebuilt it while preserving the parts that were left of the mascot character…… This is it.

**Midori**: Uwaaaaa……♪ It’s great! Even though it was so worn-out before, it looks spick and span! You’ve even painted cute colours over the parts that were peeling off! 

**Mitsuru**: You’re both incredible~! It looks brand new!

**Aira**: But the fact that I borrowed without asking and broke it still stands, so I’m sorry……!

**Midori**: No, I really don’t mind that you broke it.

Rather, to think that it can be this pretty when it was so worn-out before. Shiratori-kun, Saegusa-senpai, thank you very much……♪

**Mitsuru**: Then, you two made this today?

**Ibara**: Yes. We were fixing it up till around dusk.

**Mitsuru**: That sounds hard~. You’ve had a hard day, haven’t you, Ai-chan?

**Aira**: Mm…… That may seem like it was the case, but the truth is it really wasn’t.

**Mitsuru**: Eh?

**Aira**: Because this whole day today I was able to see a lot of  Saegusa-senpai’s surprising sides! It was a beautiful sight for an idol otaku!

(The next day)

**Ibara**: ………

…… Right. I’ve sent off replies for all the agenda that came in during my day off.

So, what next?

Ah, come to think of it, the prints sent around to be checked got back to me. I need to send a reply to the other party too.

Mm? My personal tablet is ringing. I guess that means it’s telling me about the stock prices changing again.

(…… I’m getting a sense of deja-vu. The last time I checked the market situation at a time like this, the stock price plummeted suddenly.)

Good grief…… Is it going to drop further? I’d really like for it to give me a break. Even a big loss would be considered good—

Hm? What on earth is this……? Since it’s the same situation as the other day, I thought the stock price would plummet again today. Rather, it’s suddenly rising.

(The price has almost returned to what it was before the sudden crash. At this rate, there is a possibility that the stock price will rise even more than before the sharp downward trend.

Furthermore, it looks like the other stocks I own are showing signs of upward movement across the board.)

I wonder what happened……It’s not as if a huge incident has occurred.

That reminds me……

(Flashback to Chapter 1)

**Natsume**: Maybe you could turn your luck around by reclaiming something familIAR.

(Back to present time)

**Ibara**: (Could it be because I fixed the stepping stool with Shiratori-shi……?)

………

Hah, that’s ridiculous. If fortune-telling can predict stock price fluctuations, then society will collapse.

It’s probably just that my luck has turned around lately.

Now then. I can focus my efforts on working wholeheartedly.

Even though there was an accident yesterday, contrary to my expectations, it ended up being a good break.

Seems like there’s going to be good progress with today’s work……♪
