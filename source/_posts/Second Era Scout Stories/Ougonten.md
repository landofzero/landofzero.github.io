**Mika**: Heave-ho…… Fuu…… Thanks a bunch, Shiratori-kun. Let’s take a break here fer now. 

**Aira**: We should. The unexpectedly large luggage wore me out.

**Mika**: Sorry fer draggin’ ya into this.

I was plannin’ on takin’ home some of my personal stuff from the handicraft club before I graduated, but it turned out to be more luggage than I expected.

**Aira**: No no, I had free time too. Actually, it was a feast for the eyes to see the treasured works of art belonging to Kagehira-senpai!

Also, while we were returning together, I got to hear a lot of behind the scenes stories about Machina.

As an idol otaku, it was a time of ultimate bliss♪ I’m super happy!

**Mika**: I appreciate ya sayin’ that. I feel bad that I can’t do anythin’ to thank ya fer yer help though……

**Aira**: Being able to talk about Machina with Kagehira-senpai is more than enough thanks!

Even thinking back on it now, I’m overwhelmed by that fantastic universe.

**Mika**: Ahaha, don’t praise me too much. Since it’s about me, I might get too excited over it.

**Aira**: That can’t be! From my point of view, I can’t say enough about it!

I got it! The Machina live show was good, but the show before that, “Test World,” was also amazing!

**Mika**: Eh!? Sh-Shiratori-kun, how do ya know about Test World!?

No one would know about that unless they were logged into that virtual world.

**Aira**: Ah, I didn’t see it directly! I saw the video.

Someone recorded a video of what happened in Test World and posted it on SNS.

I was so disappointed when I saw that video. I wondered why I couldn’t have gotten to see Valkyrie’s bravery with my own eyes.

Itsuki-senpai and Kagehira-senpai’s appearance at that time…… Even when I remember it, I can’t help but sigh as my tears fell.

The sight of you two looking down on everyone from above and bringing the end of the world was truly divine!

The highlight was the innocence of Kagehira-senpai, when you made money rain like hot water saying, “Art is an explosion~!”

**Mika**: I-It’s spread to that extent!?

**Aira**: Yep! I watched that scene so much I thought I was going to pierce a hole into my phone!

**Mika**: Don’t look at me like that! That’s where I think I got too carried away!

Uuu…… I guess I did too much by throwin’ away the money. That’s usually a punishment.

**Aira**: No no, I think it was a good thing!

I loved Kagehira-senpai in that scene so much that I couldn’t help but share my thoughts about it on SNS.

Kagehira-senpai’s appearance at that time, the sparkling money was like—

**Mitsuru**: (Whispering) Mika-ni\~chan should have entered this room. I’ll sneak inside and investigate……

**Mika**: Ah, that’s Mitsuru-kun ain’t it. Welcome home~. What’s goin’ on, sneakin’ around like that?

**Mitsuru**: Uwah!? Mika-ni\~chan was still in front of the door!?

**Aira**: Ah, sorry! Now that I think about it, we were standing in front of the door talking for a long while.

**Mika**: Ngah~ we’re gettin in the way of people comin’ in later. Sorry for scarin’ ya, Mitsuru-kun.

**Mitsuru**: I-it’s okay!! I’m going back to my room now, so Mika-ni\~chan and the others can enjoy chatting\~!

**Mika**: Eh, Mitsuru-kun!?

…… He left. Since he came into the room, I assume he had somethin’ to do but…

Did I say somethin’ to annoy Mitsuru-kun?

**Aira**: Hmm~mm…… Maybe he was just too surprised?

Anyway, it’s not a good idea to just stand around and talk like this. We shouldn’t surprise anyone coming in like Tenma-senpai again.

**Mika**: Alright. I don’t know if I can drag this luggage to my room.

**Aira**: That’s true…… But first, let’s have some tea and take a break. It’s never too late to carry your luggage.

Besides, I want to chat with Kagehira-senpai a bit more!

**Mika**: Haah. If you’re serious about it, let’s make some hot tea first♪

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Ougonten/26mz5jcb.png">

(Location: Starmony Dorms Hallway (1F))

**Mitsuru**: Fuu…… That was dangerous. I almost got caught by Mika-ni\~chan.

But with this I was able to learn more about Mika-ni\~chan again! I’ll make a note of it right away.

“Mika-ni\~chan was a good god who enjoyed standing and talking with his friends,” and…

Hmm…… It seems like this isn’t enough after all\~!

A\~lright, let’s find more and more divine aspects of Mika-ni\~chan!

(Location: Starmony Dorms (Ritsu and Mika’s Room))

(The next day)

**Mika**: Haah…… It’s still cold outside. Even just going out in the hallway for a moment irritates my skin.

**Ritsu**: Welcome back, Mikari\~n. It’s still cold out there isn’t it. That’s why today is the day to  just relax under the kotatsu.

Come on, Mikarin hurry up and get under. You’re cold aren’t you?

**Mika**: I can’t! I already know that if I get put under the spell of the kotatsu I won’t be able ta do anything else!

It’s a rare day off, so I have no choice but ta concentrate on my art activities or else I’ll never be able ta face Oshi-san.

**Ritsu**: That’s what you say, but Mikarin doesn’t like the cold either. If you don’t keep yourself warm, you’ll get sick, and I think that’s rather inefficient\~

See, there’s something special about drinking warm tea while cozying up under a kotatsu~♪♪

**Mika**: Uuu, if I do it just a little bit…… But I know just a little bit could be fatal.

But…… It’s still cold outside! Just for a little while, just for five minutes—

**Mitsuru**: Hmhm. Mika-ni\~chan and the kotatsu’s magic power? It seems like he can’t resist it.

**Mika**: Uwah!? Why’s Mitsuru-kun in the kotatsu!?

**Mitsuru**: Wawah!? Mika-ni\~chan found me! I gotta dash away\~!

**Mika**: So fast!? What the heck’s goin’ on……?

**Ritsu**: He got here while you were out of the room, so I let him in. I wonder if he wanted to get under the kotatsu together.

But to escape from the kotatsu’s evil influence with such speed…… It’s pretty impressive\~

**Mika**: He just wanted ta get under the kotatsu? I wonder if that’s really true. I think he was talkin’ about me……

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Ougonten/kzf2r8rz.png">

(Location: Handicrafts Club Room)

(Another day)

**Mika**: It fills me with a lot of emotion to think that I’ll be able to work in the club room fer a little while longer.

Maybe it’d be a good idea to come up with a design based on a graduation or early spring theme? Um, I guess I haven’t brought my sketchbook back home yet.

**Mitsuru**: Stare\~………

**Mika**: I feel eyes on me from the entrance!? Who’s there!?

**Mitsuru**: Wa-……!?

**Mika**: Ah, he ran!

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Ougonten/tb242cyh.png">

(Location: Yumenosaki Hallway)

**Mitsuru**: Dash dash! Mika-ni\~chan was working hard on his design today too\~!

**Mika**: Aah, I can’t see ‘im anymore. But the voice I heard just now was Mitsuru-kun’s.

I feel like Mitsuru-kun’s been followin’ me around lately. Why’s he doin’ that……?

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Ougonten/v3kyias3.png">

(Location: Season Avenue)

(Another day)

**Mika**: (I came here ta buy some art supplies I didn’t have, but……)

**Mitsuru**: (Whispering) …… I can’t have Mika-ni\~chan find me, it’s the beginning of an investigation.

Hmhm. He wanted to go out today. Is he going somewhere to play?

But playing alone would be boring. Maybe it’s just shopping……?

I’m interested either way! It looks like I’ll be able to get some good information on Mika-ni~chan!♪

**Mika**: (Uuu…… I knew it- it’s Mitsuru-kun. Why’s he following me around?

I’m not really comfortable bein’ followed around forever. Alright, if things turn out like this, then I’ll ambush him around that corner……)

**Mitsuru**: Ah, I’m gonna lose him! I have to hurry and catch up—

**Mika**: Mitsuru-kun! I caught ya!

**Mitsuru**: Uwah!? Mika-ni\~chan ambushed me!?

**Mika**: I noticed ya were followin’ behind me. More importantly, why are you doin’ this?

**Mitsuru**: Th-That’s……

Ah, there’s Oshi-san-senpai over there!

**Mika**: Eh!? Why’s Oshi-san here in a place like this!? He never said anythin’ about comin’ back……!

Huh? I can’t see Oshi-san anywhere……

**Mitsuru**: Sorry, Mika-ni\~chan! I gotta run away now, babyuu~n☆

**Mika**: Ah, I got tricked! I said I wouldn’t let him get away, but he’s already that far away……!?

As expected from the track and field club…… I can’t help but feel motivated ta chase after him.

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Ougonten/zfb6vutd.png">

(Location: Starmony Dorms Common Area)

**Mika**: (In the end, Mitsuru-kun keeps running away from me, and I don’t know why he’s following me around.

I feel like I’m being watched by Mitsuru-kun all the time, so I can’t concentrate on my creative activities……)

For now, I’ll just have some tea and calm down……

Haah, seriously. If I did somethin’ ta Mitsuru-kun, I just wanna apologize properly.

**Nagisa**: …… You seem really worried, Mika-kun. If you have any worries, I’ll hear you out.

**Mika**: Ngah!? Ran-senpai suddenly called out ta me! Ya surprised me!

**Nagisa**: …… I’m sorry. I was already in the room, but I guess you didn’t notice.

**Mika**: That seems ta be the case. I’m sorry for botherin’ ya while ya were relaxin’?

**Nagisa**: …… It’s an apology with undertones to it, it seems. Should I just accept that you don’t want to apologize to me?

**Mika**: …… Uuu, you’re forgiving. Since you’re a member of ex-fine, I got defensive on reflex.

I know that Ran-senpai meant well earlier when ya said ya would listen ta me, but……

**Nagisa**: …… The fact that I hurt you all in the past will not change. It’s only natural that Mika-kun wouldn’t meekly accept my help.

…… This is my nosiness. You are free to refuse or accept my help. Don’t worry about it.

…… Judging from your soliloquy earlier, it seems that Tenma-kun is also involved in your troubles. Perhaps we should hear what he has to say.

**Mika**: Eh, wait a second! Did you just say we were gonna talk to Mitsuru-kun?

**Nagisa**: …… I get along well with Tenma-kun. If he’s having trouble then I want to help him.

**Mika**: Ngah~, when ya put it like that  it’s hard to say no. I don’t want ya ta do anythin’ unnecessary……

Haah…… I’ll be honest with ya this time. I also want ta hear from Mitsuru-kun.

Actually, recently I’ve been having trouble with Mitsuru-kun followin’ me around.

Even when I’d try to ask him why, he’d just run away and there was nonthin’ I could do.

**Nagisa**: …… Hmm. Even if I try to guess the reason for his behavior, I don’t have enough information to come up with an answer.

…… It would be quicker to ask Tenma-kun directly. He should be in the library now.

**Mika**: Really? Isn’t it unexpected that Mitsuru-kun’s in the library?

**Nagisa**: …… It looked like he was writing. If you want to corner him so he can’t escape, now might be a good opportunity.

**Mika**: The way ya said “corner” is kinda unsettling……?

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Ougonten/iqiisjpw.png">

(Location: Starmony Dorm Library)

**Mitsuru**: U\~mm, at a time like this, Mika-ni\~chan should……It really is hard to write essays!

**Mika**: (Seems like Mitsuru-kun’s really concentratin’. At this rate, even if ya be a little flashy with yer movements, he won’t notice ya.

Even if I fail to catch Mitsuru-kun, Ran-senpai would be lying in wait at the book room’s entrance to catch him.)

**Mitsuru**: …… Will this complete it? Okay, let’s try to read through it again!

**Mika**: (Still, this time I’m the one sneaking behind Mitsuru-kun. Our positions got switched from before this, so this might get a little interestin’……

It’s sorta exciting, maybe it’s the same feeling Mitsuru-kun got from following after me.

Oh, that’s bad, that’s bad! If I keep thinkin’ unnecessary things, I’ll fail again.

This time, right here, we’ll settle the scores! Better get ready, Mitsuru-kun. The chase is gonna end today.)

Mitsuru-kun, today we really have ta’ talk—

**Mitsuru**: Hooray\~! It’s finally completed\~♪!

**Mika**: —Hn’gyah!?

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Ougonten/i8njegav.png">

**Mitsuru**: Eh? It’s Mika-ni\~chan, why are you over there?

**Mika**: Ouch, ow ow…… I fell on my butt ‘cause I was surprised by you suddenly standing up, Mitsuru-kun.

**Mitsuru**: I’m sorry, Mika-ni\~chan. It’ll be awful if you got hurt.

**Mika**: That’s all fine and dandy, so don’t worry about it. The actual cause for this was me hiding around and bein’ sneaky……

Ngahh\~! That’s right, I was hiding and sneaking around so Mitsuru-kun won’t run away!

**Mitsuru**: ? Mika-ni\~chan, did you want to play hide and seek?

Ah, in that case, I’m going to have even more things to write! I have to hurry up and add to it!

**Mika**: …… Wha? What do ya mean ya have more things to write? By the way, aren’t ya running?

**Mitsuru**: Eh? Why do I have to run away from Mika-ni\~chan?

Ah, is it because we’re going to play hide and seek? In that case, Mika-ni\~chan should start counting down!

**Mika**: No, that’s not what I was getting at…… Wh\~a?

**Nagisa**: …… It seems like there was no need for an organised plan.

**Mitsuru**: Ah, Nagisa-senpai! Hello!!

**Nagisa**: …… Greetings. Tenma-kun is energetic as always. That’s a relief.

**Mitsuru**: Yeah! I’m full of energy today too! That’s why I’m super refreshed♪ My book report homework is done too.

**Nagisa**: …… That’s why you’re in the book room then. Mika-kun told me that it’s rare for you to be here.

**Mika**: Mm, Mitsuru-kun seems the type to not like to sit still. But wait, I don’t care about that right now!

Mitsuru-kun, are you not running away from me today? Ah, I’m not saying this because I want to play hide and seek.

**Mitsuru**: Hmm~mm……But, if that’s the case, I don’t have a reason to run from Mika-ni\~chan? I’ve even finished writing my book report\~?

**Mika**: A book report? Does that have something to do with me?

**Mitsuru**: Yep. I observed Mika-ni~chan and wrote a report based on that!

**Mika**: …… Wh\~at? Hm\~mmm?

This is bad, I don’t get it. What does that mean?

**Nagisa**: …… Tenma-kun, why did you write a book report based on Mika-kun? I think normally, you would write your opinions based on a book you’ve read.

**Mitsuru**: That’s what I planned to do at first, too. But I got sleepy no matter what I read.

Then I went on the internet to look for a book where idols show up in; that even I can read. And there was a novel where Mika-ni\~chan was the main character!

**Mika**: He\~h, is that so? A novel where I was the main character ya say…….

Ngah? A novel where I’m, the main character?(1)

………

Eh. You’ve got to be kidding? There’s no way that sort of novel exists in this world.

**Mitsuru**: Nope, it really does exist. It’ll show up if you look it up on the internet!

**Nagisa**: …… Supposing that book really does exist. Why were you investigating Mika-kun’s personal business, Tenma-kun?

**Mitsuru**: Ehehe…… The truth is, I didn’t really read that novel that much. I just read the beginning part, and as expected, I got sleepy!

So, I investigated what Mika-ni\~chan usual habits are like, and wrote a book report based on that!

Because it’s a story with Mika-ni\~chan as the main character right? In that case, if I wrote about Mika-ni~chan, it’ll definitely end up as a report!

**Nagisa**: …… Hmm. If I’m not mistaken, if it was written based on rigorous research, Tenma-kun’s report could indeed be a non-fiction novel about Mika-kun.

**Mika**: Wait a second? I’m seriously not following yer logic right now……

**Nagisa**: …… Incidentally, what sort of story is the contents of that novel with Mika-kun as the main character?

**Mitsuru**: Um, you see, if I remember correctly, Mika-ni\~chan became God, saving the world……or was it domination? Maybe he was a destroyer.

I don’t really know because I only read the beginning part, but that was the sort of story it was!
image

**Mika**: That’s all messed up!  For me to be God……What did I even do and how did I do that?

Ah, could it be that it was a ‘misheard the word ‘Paper’ (2) spoken real quickly?’ kind of situation……

**Mitsuru**: Nope, you were a very great type of God! The God like in ‘Team God’ with me and Nagisa-senpai!

**Nagisa**: …… Hmm. I can’t believe Mika-kun became God. I want to try reading that novel too.

**Mika**: Can ya put yer unneeded curiosity to the side! Nna\~, for real, what’s going on!?

# Account of the Dragon's Ascension Four

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Ougonten/mq1xmc9a.png">

(Location: Starmony Dorm Library)

**Mika**: …… Fer now, I think maybe it’d be a good idea to calm down and sort out the situation?

Um, first of all, is it right that Mitsuru-kun’s been followin’ me around lately because he was gathering material for his book report?

I didn’t do anythin’ to offend Mitsuru-kun, did I?

**Mitsuru**: That’s right. Why would Mika-ni\~chan be doing something I didn’t like? I didn’t do something to offend you either, did I?

**Mika**: Right away, knowin’ that gives me some peace of mind……

But I’ve discovered an even bigger problem. What the hell, a story where I’m a god!?

**Nagisa**: …… Tenma-kun knew about the novel’s existence, but he didn’t read it, correct?

**Mitsuru**: Yeah! If Mika-ni\~chan is the main character, I thought it’d be a good idea to write about the Mika-ni\~chan who’s right in front of me!

I decided to read about the real Mika-ni\~chan instead of the one in the book!

**Mika**: Don’t say things like that, Mitsuru-kun. That’s not a book report, it’s more like an observation diary, isn’t it?

**Mitsuru**: Eh\~, even though I went through the trouble of writing it up……

**Mika**: …… Just in case, can I see what you’ve written?

**Mitsuru**: Yeah! If Mika-ni\~chan takes a look at it, I’m sure it’ll be a better report!

**Mika**: I’ll read it then.

……… (Reading silently)

……… (Gradually turns pale)

Ngaah\~! Agh, I can’t look at this! There’s so many of my embarrassin’ moments written down!

**Mitsuru**: You don’t have to be so embarrassed. Even if you slip and fall, Mika-ni\~chan is still an impressive god!

**Mika**: Even the moment where I fell down was written down……?

Mitsuru-kun, ya should probably write a proper book report, shouldn’t ya? Even if ya write about me, it won’t count as a book report.

If anythin’, Mitsuru-kun’ll probably get scolded by the teacher. You’ve gotta do yer homework properly.

**Mitsuru**: Eh\~…… I don’t want my teacher to get mad at me. Is this report really that bad?

**Mika**: Ya said it yerself. Ya wrote the report without reading the book. It’s a book report, so ya gotta read the book so ya can write about it.

**Mitsuru**: If Mika-ni\~chan says so, then I understand……

**Mika**: Thanks, Mitsuru-kun. For now, let’s say the book report issue is resolved, but the problem is……

**Nagisa**: …… The existence of a novel in which Mika-kun is the main character. I just looked it up on my phone.

…… Based on the results, novels featuring Mika-kun as the main character do exist.

**Mika**: Th-That’s a lie. It really is……

**Nagisa**: …… However, it’s merely a derivative novel. It doesn’t appear to be published in paper media or anything of the sort.

**Mika**: A derivative work……. Ngah\~, does that mean someone’s writin’ a novel with me as the main character?

**Nagisa**: …… Indeed. It seems like it’s mainly written by Mika-kun’s fans rather than a specific individual.

**Mika**: My fans are…… Why are they suddenly doin’ that?

**Nagisa**: …… Uummm. The explanation of the process is a bit confusing.

…… First of all it seems that it started with something called “Test World,” do you know what that means?

**Mika**: …… I can only think of one thing right now.

**Nagisa**: …… I don’t understand what it means, but I’ll give you the information I’ve read for now.

…… It began with Mika-kun’s behavior when the “Mechanical God” appeared in “Test World.”

…… It seems like you scattered a lot of money around there. That’s when it all started.

**Mika**: That’s what it was after all! I thought it would go up in flames after I did it. I shouldn’t have gotten carried away, you idio\~t!

**Mitsuru**: Hmm? But it’s a bad thing to be in flames, right? Mika-ni\~chan wasn’t in flames was he?

If anything, I thought everyone was getting excited and saying “Mika-ni\~chan is amazing!”

**Nagisa**: …… That’s right. It seems this derivative novel also developed into a relay novel (1) as a result of fans sharing their thoughts on SNS.

…… Then, the novel, which was only available on SNS, was made into a collection on the internet. And, as a result, it became a hot topic.

**Mika**: I-Is it possible to create a novel in such a strange way?

**Nagisa**: …… It seems that creating relay novels on forums isn’t that rare.

…… Fufu. Nevertheless, it’s interesting what all the fans think about Mika-kun.

…… Mika-kun, who scatters a lot of money while saying, “Art is an explosion\~☆” seems to become a dragon god named “Ougonten,” (2) who creates a new world. 

**Mika**: I’m not even a human anymore!? Furthermore, “Ougonten” is such an exaggerated name……

Uuu, I was prepared to be treated hostile, but on the other hand I wasn’t prepared to be worshipped like that.

**Nagisa**: …… It’s only natural that you, who was enshrined into that position without asking for it, would not be prepared for it.

…… God is an existence at an absolute height that cannot be reached by the human body.

**Mika**: I’m not that big a deal. I feel a little nervous since it feels like I’m bein’ asked to do somethin’ not within my abilities……

**Nagisa**: …… In that case, I have a good plan to slow down this trend.

**Mika**: Really? You aren’t gonna do it in a bad way, right?

**Nagisa**: …… Don’t worry. I promise I won’t do it in a way that will hurt anyone.

…… Now then, let’s begin. Now, I shall usurp the power of the rogue God.

TL notes:
<ol>
<li>A relay novel is a form of novel written by multiple people. Someone adds short sentences to the novel that the previous person has partially finished and relays it to the next person. It’s sometimes played as a high school club activity in Japan.</li>
<li>“Ougonten” means “golden god” and is a similar format to Shinto gods like the goddess of fortune Kichijōten​ who’s related to beauty, happiness, and fertility and whose name literally means “auspicious heavens”. Potentially may have a reading different from ougonten but since it’s not voiced ougonten is what I’m going with. It can also be read initially as “Golden Heaven,” how I decided to translate the title at first.</li>

(A few days later)

**Mika**: Ngah\~…… I wonder why this happened.

**Mitsuru**: Mika-ni\~chan, cheer up! Keep it together!

**Mika**: Mitsuru-kun, sorry. I understand I gotta keep it together but……

But I never thought somethin’ like this would happen if I left things to Ran-senpai.

**Nagisa**: …… I’m sorry. I didn’t expect it either. My apologies, the result was unexpected, but a little funny.

**Mika**: Funny, huh…… I’m seriously worried about this\~! I knew it, I shouldn’t have left it to Ran-senpai!

**Mitsuru**: But you also agreed with Nagisa-senpai’s strategy, right?

**Mika**: Uuu…… I thought it was a good idea when I heard it.

**Nagisa**: …… In the SNS trend of Mika-kun being a god, I introduced a new development in which I would appear as a new god.

…… The strategy was to transfer the popular trend from Mika-kun to me in the process.

…… With God Mode, I would be comfortable appearing in a context that treats me as a god.

**Mitsuru**: Actually, everyone was really excited to see Nagisa-senpai’s appearance!

Didn’t Nagisa-senpai write that first post on SNS and make it popular?

**Nagisa**: …… I used my screen name and account to prevent people from identifying me.

…… I will use that account to defeat the god Mika-kun and prepare the process for me to take his place as the new god.

…… After that, I was planning to start weaving a new story in which my fans would all treat me as a god, just the same as when Mika-kun became a god.

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Ougonten/9aj2oywi.png">

**Mika**: But the result is that the number of gods has increased to two\~. Why is it that Ran-senpai and I are supposed to rule the world as friends?

If I were to rule the world, I’d be better off doing it together with Oshi-san!

**Mitsuru**: I’m glad that Nagisa-senpai and Mika-ni\~chan have become friends!

**Nagisa**: …… I was surprised to find out that the people who consider Mika-kun a god were stronger than anticipated.

**Mika**: If anythin’, I feel like they’re more riled up than before……

**Nagisa**: …… An enemy presence is essential as an element to liven up a story. Apparently I was perfect for the casting.

…… Right now Mika-kun and I are happily ruling the world together, but the lead up was truly a battle between gods.

…… Fufu. It was interesting to see someone come up with ideas that I would never have thought of myself.

…… In particular, I would like to praise the author who turned Mika-kun into “Ougonten” and scatter gold coins, causing me to drown in a sea of golden coins.

…… It’s fairly amusing if you interpret it as Mika-kun hitting me on the cheek with a wad of bills……♪

**Mika**: I still don’t understand Ran-senpai very well. Why are ya findin’ this interestin’?

**Nagisa**: …… Is it not interesting? It was truly a passionate moment when I activated God Mode and split the sea of gold coins, wasn’t it?

**Mika**: No, I don’t care about that. The problem is that nothin’s solved in the end.

**Nagisa**: …… I’m sorry about that. Certainly, I was unable to dethrone Mika-kun from godhood.

…… If you think about it, this novel was started by Mika-kun’s fans. A story where Mika-kun loses is unforgivable.

**Mitsuru**: But Mika-ni\~chan and Nagisa-senpai’s fans all get along and enjoy the story.

**Nagisa**: …… Indeed. That was the most unexpected thing. It’s not that our fans fight, but that they influence each other and become good friends.

…… In that sense, I don’t think my nosiness this time was all that bad.

**Mika**: Well, that’s true, but……

**Nagisa**: …… In the end, this was just a temporary trend. If you wait, it’ll fade away someday.

…… Doing various things poorly to try and fix it might just be more likely to generate opportunities to create even more attention for it, like in this instance.

…… I believe the best solution is to quietly watch without overreacting.

**Mika**: I guess I should just wait until everyone gets bored and not do anythin’ unnecessary……

Hmmm. If that’s the case then that’s fine…… Haaah

**Mitsuru**: Mika-ni\~chan, are you okay? That was a big sigh wasn’t it?

**Mika**: Ahh, yeah. I’m fine, Mitsuru-kun. Thank ya lots for yer concern.

…… The fact that all my fans are writing novels with me as the main character, and that they’re excited about it…

If they’re happy, they’re happy. I think they’re doing that because they like me.

But I’m still inexperienced. It’s really uncomfortable to be treated like a god.

I’m not that big a deal. It’s like my name is taking on a life of its own……

**Mitsuru**: Mika-ni\~chan……

I can kinda understand how Mika-ni\~chan feels.

I’ve always played cool roles, so I’ve always seen myself as a cool person.

So I thought maybe that’s what people wanted from me……

It’s like they don’t see the real me and I feel lonely.

**Mika**: I feel like saying I’m lonely is a little different but…… That’s right, isn’t it.

Mitsuru-kun, you still keep getting cool roles don’t you? Don’t you think it’s tough?

**Mitsuru**: Yep! But it’s fun to play cool roles!

Mika-ni\~chan would also be happy to have a story written where you’re the main character, right?

**Mika**: It’s like I said before. I’m happy to have people who accept me no matter what.

**Mitsuru**: Then you should cherish that Mika-ni\~chan like that!

**Mika**: Eh? What do ya mean by cherishing me like that?

**Mitsuru**: Hmm…… I dunno! I don’t really understand difficult things either!

But the most important thing is that Mika-ni\~chan is happy!

I think it’s be great if Mika-ni\~chan enjoyed the part that makes you feel happy!

**Mika**: …… I see. I kinda understand what Mitsuru-kun wanted to say.

I was thinkin’ about it too deeply, but I think it might be a good idea to enjoy the current situation.

If that’s the case, I’ll try to enjoy this situation a little more now that I’ve become a god♪

**Nagisa**: …… Is it correct to think that you’ve sorted out your feelings?

**Mika**: Yep. Thanks to Mitsuru-kun, I feel like I’ve gotten over it. Thank you♪

**Mitsuru**: Ehehe! If Mika-ni\~chan feels better, then I’ll be happy too!

**Mika**: Ran-senpai…… There’s a lot of things I want to say, but I’d like to thank ya fer helpin’ me this time.

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu. I don’t think I was much help this time.

**Mika**: Don’t worry about the details! Please accept my gratitude sincerely.

**Nagisa**: …… Is that so, I’m happy to have you thank me. I, too, will be sincerely happy.

(A few days later)

**Mitsuru**: I’m back\~! Freshly baked bread is waiting for me!

**Aira**: Ufufuu. There were lots of delicious looking breads. I’m looking forward to eating it now……♪

That bakery had a good selection. I might go back in the future♪

**Mitsuru**: Ehehe, I’m happy you like it. I’m glad I invited Ai-chan!

**Aira**: Tenma-senpai bought a lot of bread, but will you be able to eat all that?

**Mitsuru**: It’s alright! Actually, I’m not going to eat a lot. After all, this is my reward for working hard on my book report!

**Aira**: Book report, huh… Now that I think about it, I got homework today too.

What did you read and write your report on?

**Mitsuru**: I read the short story Hajime-chan chose for me. I asked him to choose the simplest content possible.

**Aira**: Hmmm…… Is this the book Shino-senpai chose?

I wonder if Shino-senpai would be able to recommend a book to me if I asked him. I’ll talk to him later♪

**Mitsuru**: More importantly, Ai-chan, let’s eat the bread quickly- it’s getting cold!

**Aira**: Alright. Before eating, I’ll make some tea♪ With bread, I’d go for black tea.

**Mika**: Ah, it’s Mitsuru-kun and Shiratori-kun. I’m back~

**Mitsuru**: Mika-ni\~chan! Welcome back~!

**Aira**: Kagehira-senpai, would you also like to join us for tea? We also have some delicious bread right now.

**Mika**: Is that fine? If so then I’ve also got somethin’ I wanna mention. There’s somethin’ I want ya both to see.

**Mitsuru**: What do you wanna show us? What what- I’m curious!

**Mika**: I think it was stored right in my bag…… Ah, there it is.

What do the two of ya think about this?

**Mitsuru**: Wow! This costume sketch is so cool!

**Aira**: This is a rough design of a costume, huh. Uwah, it’s awesome to be able to see Kagehira-senpai’s designs!

And this costume is something new that hasn’t been put on display by Valkyrie before……

Could it be that this costume is the one that’ll be used at the next Valkyrie live?

**Mika**: Ah, sorry fer makin’ ya look forward to it. This costume isn’t going to be worn at a live. This is somethin’ I drew to wind down.

See, I heard about a novel the other day. Using the story from that time as a reference, I came up with a good design and sketched it.

**Aira**: Novel? What are you talking about?

**Mitsuru**: You’re talking about the story where Mika-ni\~chan became a god, right?

**Aira**: Eh!? What do you mean Kagehira-senpai became a god?

**Mika**: Ahaha…… Actually, there was a novel that got popular on the internet where I got made into a god.

**Aira**: There’s really a novel like that!? Uwah, I must have missed it.

**Mika**: Ahaha, well, it’s a derivative work written by a fan.

I read up on it too. In the end, I was embarrassed at being treated like a god.

Seriously, why did they give me a fancy name like “Ougonten” and turn me into a golden dragon?

What kind of thinkin’ did they have to come up with the idea of turnin’ me into a dragon?

**Aira**: Heeh, Kagehira-senpai turned into a golden dragon……

Hm? The golden dragon, “Ougonten”……

**Mika**: What is it, Shiratori-kun?

**Aira**: Um, wait a sec. Now I’ve got something I really wanna look into……

………

**Mitsuru**: What is it, Ai-chan!? You look really pale. Are you sick?

**Aira**: No, I just realized something’s wrong……

Um, did you mention that Kagehira-senpai is a golden dragon named “Ougonten”……?

**Mika**: Yeah, but… What’s goin’ on?

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Ougonten/o7l7eff98xiwe3cs.png">

**Aira**: —Kagehira-senpai, I’m sorry!

W-Well…… I may have been the one to start calling Kagehira-senpai “Ougonten!”

**Mika**: Eh!? Then, you’re the one who wrote a novel about me as a god, Shiratori-kun?

**Aira**: I didn’t write a novel! But, I just posted my impressions of “The Mechanical God” on SNS!

At that moment, Kagehira-senpai was so divine. The money you were scattering looked like dragon scales……

Then, out of excitement, I thought ‘That’s the dragon god\~!’ and I gave you the name “Ougonten.”

**Mika**: S-So that’s what happened. By the way, why did ya call me “Ougonten?” It’s such an exaggerated name.

**Aira**: Well, talking about the god of money, that’s Daikokuten, isn’t it? A slight modification of that is “Ougonten.”

At that time, Kagehira-senpai was shining with all the money you had!

**Mika**: Now that I think about it, when I talked to ya earlier, ya expressed similar feelings.

I get it. The impressions that Shiratori-kun posted back then was what started it all.

**Aira**: Yes. That’s why…… I’m sorry I made you feel bad!

**Mika**: Ya don’t gotta apologize. I’m not that bothered by it anymore.

**Aira**: R-Really?

**Mika**: Yep. It was because of yer words that I was able to draw this costume design.

That experience gave me a lotta inspiration, and I’ve come up with a bunch of creative ideas~♪

**Aira**: That’s a relief\~. I was wondering what I would do if I did cause trouble for Kagehira-senpai……

**Mitsuru**: Hey hey, Mika-ni\~chan. Why don’t you show that costume design to Anzu-ne\~chan?

**Mika**: Eh, show this to Anzu-chan? But I just drew this design for fun.

**Mitsuru**: It’s such a good design that it’d be a waste to leave it as is!

**Aira**: That’s right! Isn’t the reason you showed us the design because you wanted someone to see it?

**Mika**: …… That’s true. Right, maybe it would be better to show it off.

But if I’m going to show it to Anzu-chan, there’s some parts I want to be a little more elaborate on. I need to improve the quality even more, so even Oshi-san can see it.

**Mitsuru**: Oh, as expected of Mika-ni\~chan. That costume is gonna be so cool, isn’t it?

**Aira**: I’m excited to see what kind of design it’ll be♪ Please be sure to show me when it’s done.

**Mika**: Of course! Thanks for having my back, you two. 

Once the design is complete, I’ll definitely show it to you, so please be patient♪
