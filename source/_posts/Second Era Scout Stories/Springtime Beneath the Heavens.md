**Season**: Spring (Year 2)

# The Coming of Dreams, Encircling Fate One

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/cg1.png">

(Location: Meeting Room)

(Spring of ES’s second year, April. In the meeting room)

**Izumi**: Coming i\~n. You’re pretty bold to go through the trouble of calling me, aren’t you, Tenshouin? 

…… Huh?

**Hokuto**: Sena-senpai? Unfortunately, I’m not Tenshouin. 

**Izumi**: I get that without you needing to point it out. Can you not make fun of me? 

**Hokuto**: No, I’m not making fun of you. You mistook me for Tenshouin-senpai, so I pointed it out just in case.

**Izumi**: I told you already, I know that. Sooooo annoying! 

If you’re here, then were you also called in by Tenshouin? 

**Hokuto**: Yes, but I wasn’t told the reason.  

**Izumi**: Hmmm……. If he just wanted to chat, then we could’ve done it at Starmony Dorm, but since we were called here it most likely means it’s a work discussion, right? 

But why’d it have to be with you? If I had a choice, I would’ve liked to be with Yuu-kun, you know? 

**Hokuto**: Even if you tell me that, it won’t help you. Give your complaints to Tenshouin-senpai. 

Also, it’s unprofessional to be complaining when you still haven’t been told anything, don’t you think? 

**Izumi**: Don’t lecture me about the truth. You’re quite cheeky despite being my junior. 

Hokuto and **Izumi**: ………

**Izumi**: …… Can’t you say something? It’s awkward, isn’t it.

**Hokuto**: It’s like you said, this isn’t a casual conversation type of relationship. 

**Izumi**: I know that but, come oon……. It’s just the two of us here in this quiet room…… It’s uncomfortable, right? So cooperate, will you? 

Um. So like— how are Trickstar doing these days? 

**Hokuto**: Hm……. You’re from another agency, so I can’t say much. 

For now, we aren’t doing anything major. We’re just doing the work we’re asked to do one at a time. 

Students and office workers have different life rythms, so until we get used to it we won’t be settled down for a while. 

**Izumi**: So that’s how it is. Right now it’s probably feeling like a preparation period everywhere. 

**Hokuto**: That is to say, Knights feels that as well? 

**Izumi**: For now. For better or worse, we depend on our King, so if Kasa-kun says the word we could suddenly get swamped. 

…… And while we were chatting and connecting, we can hear footsteps

**Eichi**: Hello, it seems everyone’s here. 

**Izumi**: You’re late, Tenshouin. 

**Eichi**: Hm? But if my watch isn’t broken, then I should be on time? 

**Izumi**: Hmph. I did you the favor of coming early, so you should’ve done the same. 

**Eichi**: My my, that’s an unreasonable demand, isn’t it. 

Now then, let’s immediately get to the main topic. 

I think you’ve both experienced this yourselves too, but recently the idol work has become increasingly complex. 

Which is why, with the advent of the new fiscal year, the four agencies have decided to collaborate and produce the “ES Idol Directory.”(1) 

**Hokuto**:  The “ES Idol Directory”……

**Eichi**: Indeed. To be brief, it’s an idol catalogue. Fans can know more about the idols, and have a chance to discover idols they don’t know about yet. 

From the point of view of the clients, they’ll also be able to find suitable idols for their projects easier. As though they’re choosing from a menu at a restaurant. 

**Izumi**: You’re talking so proudly about it, but aren’t there already books like that out there for a while? 

**Eichi**: You’re correct. However, there’s immense meaning in ES officially publishing it, and it gives it special value. 

The “ES Idol Directory” can be a reliable resource for the industry, and the sound of “official” evokes persuasiveness in fans.

Above all else, the most important aim of this is that the four agencies will be easily prioritized for work requests. In other words, the goal is to have the industry revolve around idols belonging to ES. 

Although, naturally, we can’t control everything. It’s not a bad plan, don’t you think? 

**Izumi**: Hmph……. No matter how much you emphasise how “official” it is, it’s up to the fans and clients to look it over, isn’t it? 

If they see how blatant it is, they might be put off instead. 

**Hokuto**: I feel the same way. If they sense how blatantly profit-driven this is, if anything it would have the opposite effect. 

**Eichi**: Of course, that point is sufficiently taken into consideration. Specifically, I’ve decided to put up a front of getting to know the idols more and content that will naturally make people want to get ahold of it. 

The way you present it can alter their impression of it. I intend to make it a dependable directory of superior quality. 

Now then, onto the main topic— 

**Izumi**: But you said this was the main topic earlier? 

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/cg3.png">

**Eichi**: Fufu, this time it’s the real main topic♪ 

For the “ES Idol Directory”, we will have to select one idol from each agency to appear on the cover and do an interview.

As what you might call “the faces of the agencies.” 

And so, Hokuto from StarPro and Sena-kun from NewDi have been selected. Congratulations, you two. 

**Hokuto**: I’ll say “thank you” for now, but…… If it’s serving as the face of the agency, then shouldn’t Tenshouin-senpai be in charge? 

**Eichi**: No, you’re qualified for it. I may have said “the face of the agency,” but it’s simply a role in the directory rather than something so revered. 

Additionally, I won’t personally go out for a project I developed myself, you see. I have work as director, so I’m incredibly busy. 

Incidentally, Sena-kun was Tsumugi’s endorsement. He wants you to appear on the cover so that your modeling opportunities will increase. 

**Izumi**: Hmph. He says that stuff like that, but really is just thinking about insignificant stuff, isn’t he? 

Well, since I’ve been nominated I’ll do it ernestly. I’d like to increase my exposure in order to grab the world’s attention. 

If this is a chance for me to expand my work, I’ll do whatever. 

So if NewDi is represented by me, and StarPro is represented by Hidaka…… What about CosPro and Rhythm Link? Who’ll be appearing for them? 

**Eichi**: That’s yet to be decided. Participant selection was entrusted to me.

Perhaps they believe I can work with any idol, or perhaps they’re trying to test my tastes. 

Regardless, who should it be, I wonder? An idol who can catch the public’s eye at a glance, would work well…

# The Coming of Dreams, Encircling Fate Two

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/cg4.png">

(Location: Starmony Dorms Hallway (2F))

(The following morning.)

**Kaoru**: Mmm~, I feel so refreshed♪ This season’s cold air made the warm sunbeams feel so nice that I ended up walking a lot more than I planned to.

It’s fun to choose a path I don’t usually go on, so my bounty was finding a Kissaten(1) that looks like it’s got a good atmosphere. I think I’ll drop by next time.

Maybe a morning walk isn’t that bad once in a while……♪ 

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/cg5.png">

(Location: Starmony Dorm (Kaoru, Yuta, Nagisa's Room))

**Kaoru**: (Whispering) I’m ho\~me.

**Yuuta**: Eh? It’s Hakaze-senpai. 

Welcome back.  Could you be coming home after staying out all night\~? 

**Kaoru**: Hey hey. You know that I watched a TV drama before sleeping yesterday, right? 

**Yuuta**: Sorry. You greeted me with a whisper, so♪

Do you have a job starting at this time?

**Kaoru**: I was just on a walk. Moricchi recommended it, ‘cause he said it’ll make me feel refreshed. 

“Going on a morning walk’s so grandpa-ish\~” was what I thought. But when I actually tried it, it was unexpectedly nice. 

**Yuuta**: Heeh\~. How unexpected of you to be fond of a healthy lifestyle, Hakaze-senpai. 

**Kaoru**: Unexpected, you say. Well, since I look like this, I often get told that I look like I play around a lot; and the truth is, there was a period of time when I did. 

**Yuuta**: Ah. That aforementioned high school debut, right? 

**Kaoru**: Ahaha, so you remember…… Yep yep, that cringeworthy guy. But since then, I’ve been looking after my health. 

I don’t mean like “your body is your asset.” It’s because it’s lame to be a nuisance to others because of your own carelessness.

By the way, you’re on holiday aren’t you? You’ve got no school– it’s unusual to see you up so early. 

**Yuuta**: I’ve got work today, after thi\~s. 

**Kaoru**: Oh\~, as expected of someone who’s in demand♪ 

**Yuuta**: No no, someone who’s in demand wouldn’t be called up this early in the morning…… 

However, I’m accepting all the offers I can so that I’ll become someone like that. Little and often fills the purse…….♪(2) 

Oops, I gotta get going. So, I’m o\~ut! 

**Kaoru**: See you. Do your best at work\~ 

Now then…… Wonder what I should do now. 

Should I go for breakfast or should I go for a short na—— hm? 

**Nagisa**: …… Good morning, Kaoru-kun.

**Kaoru**: Ran-kun. Did I wake you, sorry?  

**Nagisa**: …… Don’t worry about it. I did mean to wake up around this time after all. 

...... I had a curious(3) dream. 

...... A dream where the four of us in Eden were seriously playing Onigokko(4) in the courtyard.

..... At first, we were playing Onigokko like normal. Suddenly, there was a clap of thunder and real Onis appeared. 

...... It became a fight to protect the peace in Starmony. 

....... Hiyori-kun had a magic stick, Ibara had a golden bazooka, and Jun had a nailed bat. They fought using those items. 

**Kaoru**: What about you, Ran-kun? 

**Nagisa**: …… I was combat service support. I restored everyone’s strength by singing. 

...... At that time, a snake suddenly appeared at my foot.

...... A sublimely beautiful white snake. 

...... While I was looking at that snake, my surroundings became engulfed in light. That was when I woke up. 

...... I wonder what that snake was about? 

**Kaoru**: That’s what you’re wondering about? I, on the other hand, would prefer to know the battle with the Onis in detail. 

**Nagisa**: ……. In detail?

………

...... The snake was more memorable. I don’t really remember that other parts. Sorry. 

**Kaoru**: Ahaha. It’s no problem. So that snake was just that beautiful. 

**Nagisa**: ...... Mm. Because it was the first time I ever saw a white snake. 

...... But I do have a “venomous snake’’ near me, so I’m familiar with them. 

**Kaoru**: That’s referring to Saegusa-kun isn’t it? I don’t want to be familiar with a real life venomous snake. 

So a white snake…… Now that you mention it, I feel like I heard about “Dreaming of a white snake is an omen of happiness” on the TV or something…….? 

I wonder if the dream you saw was an auspicious dream, Ran-kun? 

**Nagisa**: …… An auspicious dream? 

**Kaoru**: It means a dream that is considered to be a good omen. The most well known is Mt Fuji first, a hawk second, an eggplant third (5)…… 

Wait a sec, okay, I’m going to check using my smartphone. ‘Dreaming of a white snake’... 

...... Look, something showed up. It says dreaming of a white snake is the precursor of an arrival of a large fortune.

It seems that seeing a white snake in real life is a good omen too. In the dream, you found it in the middle of the courtyard didn’t you? 

It could be that it’s the premonition of you actually finding it in real life. Ju~st kidding♪ 

**Nagisa**: ………

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/cg8.png">

(Location: Starmony Dorms Courtyard)

(Several hours later)

**Tetora**: Wo-oh, wo-oh♪(6) 

Passionately passionately invigorated\~♪ Fate power gives energy\~♪ (6)

...... Ah, I messed up! I’ve been humming to myself again! 

Singing my solo song in the karate club has 100% become tradition, so I ended up singing it while running without realizing it. 

It ends up happening when I’m running alone and I let my guard down. It’s a little embarrassing. 

...... No. I’m sure that’s proof of my inattention! Just like training, I should not think about anything and just run! 

I gotta push myself to run by putting in my all! UwooOO~! 

**Nagisa**: …… I see. So it’s not here either. 

...... I’ll keep looking again after taking a little break. 

**Tetora**: UGYAAAAAAA!?

AWAWA!? S-something that looks like Ran-senpai came out from the bushes…..! 

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/nagisacg.png">

**Nagisa**: …… It’s not something that looks like me, but it’s the genuine Ran Nagisa. 

........ Sorry for startling you?

# The Coming of Dreams, Encircling Fate Three

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/cg9.png">

(Location: Starmany Dorms Courtyard)

**Nagisa**: …… You look like you were knocked right off your feet. May I lend a hand?

**Tetora**: I-I’m all good! I just wasn’t expecting someone to pop out of the bushes! 

This spring weather caught me totally offguard, y’know. I gotta brace myself in case a tough guy comes in trying to challenge me to a match! 

**Nagisa**: …… That’s a wonderful attitude to have. I heard spring is the time of year when the climate and environment go through fierce changes, so it’s easy to for your condition to get knocked off balance. 

…… For idols, their bodies are important above all else. Please take care. 

**Tetora**: Yessir! Thanks for the warning! 

By the way, what’re you doing here? 

**Nagisa**: …… Well… I’m looking for a white snake. 

**Tetora**: White snake…… Wh- A SNAKE!? 

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. It’d be nice if I could find it, but… 

**Tetora**: No no, that’s not good at all! 

A snake!? If it suddenly appeared like you did, I’d probably have a heart attack! 

**Nagisa**: …… You don’t have to be so scared. I had just looked into it, and white snakes seem to be non-venomous and gentle. 

…… It’s probably safer than our “venomous snake”— Ibara. 

**Tetora**: Ummmm, is that an inside joke between Eden? I don’t really know how to react here. 

Anyway, why’re you looking for a snake?

**Nagisa**: …… To be honest, I had a dream about a white snake. It was incredibly striking. 

…… Since I saw it in my dream around here, I thought perhaps it would be here too in reality. 

…… Because of that, I’ve been turning over rocks and pushing through the grass in search of it. 

**Tetora**: I see…… 

Alright, I help ya out! 

**Nagisa**: …… You will? That makes me glad, but I cannot guarantee we’ll find it, okay? 

…… It’s said to be a good omen because of how uncommon it is to find one.

**Tetora**: Whether we find it or not is the next step. It seems like it’ll be a good workout– like lifting weights or squats.  

And if we find the white snake while we’re at it, it’ll be a HUGE W♪ 

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu, thanks. Then, let’s search together. 

(30 minutes later)

**Rei**: (The sunlight feels wonderful. If the weather was like this the entire year, I might not have become so adverse to the sun 

There’s still plenty of time, so I’ll treat myself to a nap in the tree’s shade while the spring breeze blows♪)

……. Oya?

Ran-kun and Nagumo-kun? Such a rare combination– what are they doing here? 

**Tetora**: Ah, Sakuma-senpai. Right now we’re checking around for a white snake. 

**Rei**: Hm…… I haven’t heard of that sort of thing living in the area. 

If there was truly one here, Hasumi-kun would be the first to sound the alarm. What is this all about? 

**Nagisa**: …… This morning, I dreamt of a white snake. 

After I told Kaoru-kun this, he taught me that “white snakes are an omen of happiness.” He said it’s probably actually a prophetic dream that I’d find it. 

…… Real white snakes also seem to be good luck, so I thought I would search around a little.  

**Tetora**: And I’m helping! 

**Rei**: Is that so. He meant no harm, but he’s gotten Ran-kun covered in mud, and dragged Nagumo-kun into it as well. Such a wicked man, that Kaoru-kun. 

**Tetora**: U~myu? I volunteered to do it. I wasn’t forced into it! 

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. I’m also here of my own free will. Kaoru-kun isn’t to blame. 

**Rei**: Hm, if that’s how it is then it’s fine. 

Well, in place of an apology, I’ll also help you look for the white snake♪ 

**Nagisa**: …… You too, Sakuma-kun? In those clothes?  

**Rei**: Yes. I don’t particularly care if it gets a little dirty since I’ll wash it anyway. 

Recently, I’ve been trying to actively join in on things that seem fun. You only have one life to live, so wouldn’t it be a waste to not live it to the fullest? 

For various reasons, I have a little experience in searching for cryptids. So, how about you add me to your group♪  

**Tetora**: Ahaha. What kind of reason is that? 

**Rei**: The Mystery Researchers Club’s  activities. The name and members may make you think it’s an indoors circle, but—

In reality, it’s an incredibly active circle that makes every effort to seek out sacred sites and legendary creatures. 

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/cg11.png">

**Nagisa**: …… Hmm, the Mystery Researchers Club seems fun like I expected. 

**Rei**: Like you expected, you say? Do you know something about it? 

**Nagisa**: …… Yeah.  Since I’m still growing as a human being, I like studying about things I don’t know. 

…… That’s why I was interested in the Mystery Researchers Club where I could experience the unknown, and thought I would join it. 

But Ibara told me “If you frequently leave my sight, it’ll become difficult to manage your schedule.” So I gave up on it. 

**Rei**: I see. You may be dazzling on stage, but your everyday self is filled with curiosity.  

**Nagisa**: …… I can say the same of you. You also shine on the stage.  

…… Fufu. I’m sure our fans don’t imagine us in this way. 

**Tetora**: —It’s not just the fans, I can’t believe the state of the both of you right now.  

**Nagisa**: …… Tetora-kun?

**Tetora**: Ahaha. Sorry for suddenly busting into the conversation.  

**Rei**: I don’t mind it. I was the one who intruded on you two. Rather, I’ll be more considerate and be silent.  

**Nagisa**: …… I see. It’s alright to not hold back. We three are looking for the white snake, after all. 

**Tetora**: But…… Even if you say that, I’m still worried. Both of you guys are popular unit leaders.   

So it’s surprising……. Now that I think about it, you two feel kinda similar. 

Even though Sakuma-senpai and Ran-senpai are both mega important dudes with last boss vibes, you have a childish side too.  

Oh, sorry! Even though I’m your junior, I said something brash……! 

**Nagisa**: …… Don’t worry about it. That’s my nature. If other people see and feel discomfort at my words and actions…… 

…… Then I’m currently having fun doing something I wasn’t able to experience as a young boy. 

**Rei**: Yes. I’m similar.

Kukuku. Our characters are similar after all……♪ 

# The Coming of Dreams, Encircling Fate Four

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/cg12.png">

(Location: Starmony Dorms Common Room)

(Several hours later. Around noon)

**Tetora**: Ultimately, we weren’t able to find the white snake. 

**Nagisa**: …… Yeah. I’m sorry you’re not able to get anything out of this even though you kept me company. 

**Tetora**: No no, I got good exercise out of it so it’s no problem! I got to do a lot of stretching, so I’m personally satisfied. 

**Rei**: Mm. I’m not despairing either. We were not searching with the expectation that we would definitely find it. 

Besides. The fruits of our labour is the discovery of quite a few dog toys. They seem to be lost items, so Leon-kun and Daikichi-kun and the likes would be happy. 

It’s a good change of pace too♪ How about going for lunch together after this? 

**Nagisa**: …… Lunch, you say? Then, is it okay if I were to make it? 

**Tetora**: Ooh, Ran-senpai, you can cook?! 

**Nagisa**: …… More or less. But I’m too inexperienced to be able to declare that I can do it. 

…… But previously, there were times when Ibara wasn’t able to make dinner. That was when I first attempted it. 

…… It was my first time shopping for food, and my first time cooking. 

……. Shu-kun who happened to be there while I was shopping, was astounded. Still, the food I made at the time couldn’t hold a candle to Ibara’s. 

…… Even so, it became a good, memorable experience. That’s why sometimes I feel like I want to do it myself. 

**Tetora**: Heh~. I wonder what Ran-senpai’s home cooking is like? I’m looking forward to it! 

**Rei**: I am as well. Before that, we should get a change of clothes. Me, as well as you guys, have been completely covered in dirt. 

**Eichi**: I’m ba~ck.

**Rei**: Hm? That voice……

**Nagisa**: …… Welcome back, Eichi-kun. Hokuto-kun and Izumi-kun are with you too it seems. 

**Izumi**: Uwah. What’s up with all that filth. You’re all like a set, all covered in dirt, what’d you do to get like that? Were you working in the fields? 

I don’t really care anyway, but can you not come close to me? 

**Tetora**: I’ll be careful! By the way, we weren’t working the fields. 

**Eichi**: If that’s the case, did you perhaps get into an intense scuffle outside? 

For Sakuma-kun whose selling point is “Extreme Immorality”, to be covered in dirt, ahaha…...♪ 

**Rei**: Hmph. It’s great that it could get a laugh from you. 

By nature, my charms won’t be ruined even if I’m covered in dirt. If anything, you could say that my profoundity would only get deeper…..♪ 

**Hokuto**: I think usually that would hurt you. It’s better if you get changed quickly. 

No, before that, you should tell us if something happened. I’d be in a fix if I was left with an unsolved riddle. 

**Nagisa**: ….. We were looking for a white snake in the courtyard. 

**Eichi**: A white snake? What’s that, how cryptic. 

**Izumi**: There shouldn’t be anything like that. If there is, it’d be a problem. That’s dangerous.

**Nagisa**: …… It’s okay. I heard that white snakes aren’t venomous(1). 

**Izumi**: No no, it’s not a matter of whether it’s dangerous or not. 

**Hokuto**: I don’t think it’s right to lump all snakes together and hating them. My Grandma said that the moult of snakes can bring good luck. 

When I was smaller, Grandma happily let me search for it. 

**Izumi**: Oh I see…… You, you’re the sort who picks up the shells of cicadas and stuff aren’t you. 

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/hokutocg.png">

**Hokuto**: You’re keen. I heard that the shells of cicadas are symbols of luck too. I used to hunt around for it all over during summertime.  

In the end, I wasn’t able to find any snake moult, but the cicada ones were much easier. I was so happy, I brought home a mountain of them. 

**Izumi**: Geh….. Just imagining it is gross. You don’t have to keep talking about it, so shut up. 

**Hokuto**: But you were the one who kept talking about the topic? How irrational. 

**Nagisa**:..... Hmm, so even the moult is a good omen.  

…… Snakes are amazing. It makes me want to see it with my own eyes even more. 

**Eichi**: You seem to be having quite a lot of fun. I wonder why you’re charmed by snakes to that extent, Nagisa-kun? 

**Nagisa**: ….. This morning, a white night snake appeared in my dream. I told Kaoru-kun about it, and it seems that dreaming of a white snake is the precursor of an arrival of a large fortune

……That’s why. When I heard that the white snake is a good omen in real life too, I thought what if it’s possible and started looking for it. 

**Izumi**: Because of possibility, you say…… 

…… It’s not there right? It really isn’t there right? 

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. Unfortunately. 

**Izumi**: It’s soo not unfortunate! Haah, thank goodness it’s not there……Worst case, I just won’t be able to walk in the courtyard ever again. 

**Eichi**: Hmm…… So this is fate too. You should be good. 

**Rei**: Eh. What are you talking about, Tenshouin-kun? 

**Eichi**: Shortly, we’ll be releasing a special edition catalogue called the “ES Idol Directory”. 

The idols in charge of being on the cover and talking interview were planned to be singularly selected by name from the 4 agencies. 

The ones chosen from StarPro is Hokuto, and from NewDi it’s Sena-kun. 

I haven’t decided who to pick from CosPro and RhyLin. I was unable to make my mind up on who it should be. 

**Rei**: That’s why you want to choose me and Ran-kun, then? 

**Eichi**: Indeed. Your merit and track records leave nothing to be desired, and when all four of you are lined up together, there is exquisite balance. I’m sure all the agencies would agree. 

Since it’s a good opportunity to put your face out there, it wouldn’t be a bad deal for you. Would you take up on it? 

**Nagisa**: …..Okay. I’ll take it. 

……I wasn’t able to find the white snake in real life. 

……But since I received a new job, the white snake in my dream might have been an omen of good luck.

……Still. I feel a bit sorry, Sakuma-kun and I were chosen, but it’s like Tetora-kun who searched for the white snake with us is being left out.

**Tetora**: No, no. I’m from StarPro so it’s unrelated. 

I agree with Ran-senpai and Sakuma-senpai to adorn the cover. It just feels like it’s what you’d expect from you two! 

**Rei**: Nagumo-kun is so understanding. Just like this, you’ve comforted me, and Ran-kun should be able to accept without any reservation. 

**Nagisa**: ……Yes. Your words have pushed me forward from behind, Tetora-kun. Thank you. 

**Tetora**: Ahaha. I didn’t do anything. 

If it’s an idol catalogue, it means that I’ll be appearing in it too right? I can’t wait to see what the result would look like......☆ 

<br>

TL NOTES:
<ol>
<li>無毒 (mudoku): Not poisonous, not venomous. Some snakes are venomous, some are poisonous. There are snakes that are both venomous and poisonous, and there are snakes that are neither. Nagisa is saying that the white snake is not poisonous or venomous.</li>

# The Coming of Dreams, Encircling Fate Five

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/cg15.png">

(Location: Simple Studio)

(Several days later. At the “ES Idol Directory” gravure photoshoot) 

**Hokuto**: —My shoot’s finished up. You’re up next, Sakuma-senpai. 

**Rei**: Alright. Now then, how about we wrap this up in short order? 

…… Is what I thought. Sena-kun, won’t you come over here for a moment? 

**Izumi**: Hm? What is it? 

**Rei**: I can put my experiences up until now to good use and go with an innocuous pose, but— 

This is a rare opportunity and I thought I’d try and entertain a third party’s opinion. 

You’re modeling overseas, aren’t you? Why don’t you coach me on it♪ 

**Izumi**: What? What a bother– why should I have to do that? 

**Rei**: Now don’t say that. Knowing you, you want to make it a fine directory, don’t you? 

Look look, it’s super model Izumi Sena-ku\~n♪  

**Izumi**: Ugh seriously, so annoying! 

I got it, I got it! Stand there. 

Since you asked for my opinion, you’ll listen to me obediently and without any complaints. Got it? 

Hmmmm. I see…… 

Honestly, I’m irritated since no matter what you do, you look good. First off, focus completely on your fingers. 

**Rei**: My fingers, huh? 

**Izumi**: Yes. “God is in the details,” as they say. Everyone knows your face and figure are good so I’ll give you a pass there. 

And that’s why, in your case, I think minute gestures and subtle facial movements should be focused on. 

Ordinary idols don’t have to worry about that sort of thing. So, seeing as you asked for my opinion, you should work on it as much as possible. 

To pay attention to those kinds of details and pursue perfection…… Or is it in the idol “Sakuma Rei”’s nature to be able to do it effortlessly? 

**Rei**: I see. As expected of a professional’s opinion. 

**Izumi**: Is that sarcasm I hear? If you have the time to be impressed then strike a pose here and now. 

**Rei**: How about this? 

**Izumi**: It needs more. Pose with the intent to sear your existence in the minds of the guys behind the camera. 

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/reicg.png">

**Rei**: Hm. Then, I’ll try and get a bit serious. 

………♪

**Izumi**: Alright, you pass. With this one the cameraman can be quiet and just snap the pictures. 

…… Jeez, so irritating. I’ve helped out the enemy.  

**Nagisa**: …..Isn’t Izumi-kun amazing Izumi-kun, you’re amazing.  

**Izumi**: GYAH!? Wh- Ran! Don’t speak up so suddenly, you surprised me…! 

**Nagisa**: …… Sorry. But whenever I try to think about it, it’s perplexing. How do I start a conversation without startling the other person? 

…… Even just by greeting someone, there are times where I’ve startled them. 

**Izumi**: Then how about you make an effort to make your presence stronger? How should I know? 

Anyway, what do you mean by “amazing”?

**Nagisa**: …… Your precise advise to Sakuma-kun resonated with me. 

…… You said you helped the enemy, but I could feel your heartfelt desire to create something good.  

**Izumi**: What? You’re flattering me for some reason, even though I didn’t do anything major, y’know? 

It’s only right to make something good. I absolutely refuse to appear in the directory if it isn’t up to par. 

And besides, if I don’t give proper advice then I’d be making a mistake that could tarnish my value. That is, I’m doing this for myself alone.  

**Nagisa**: …… Okay. That stance is also wonderful, isn’t it? It’s both for your own sake and for those around you. 

…… Your opinion helped me during the group photo shoot. The cameraman also happily said Iit’ll be a nice cover.” 

**Izumi**: It was only because the need arose. Everyone was just adopting their ideal pose and the entire thing’s cohesiveness was lost— 

…… Well, aaa whatever. What are you intending to do with that kind of praise?  Do you want me to get carried away? Cut it out. 

**Nagisa**: …… Sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you.

**Hokuto**: Don’t worry, Ran-senpai. Sena-senpai’s always been quick to anger. 

I think this is a considerably more amicable version compared to before, though. 

**Izumi**: You– what do you know? We’re not friends. 

**Rei**: Kukuku. What a lively, heartwarming, and cozy scene this is………………♪ 

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/cg16.png">

(Location: Meeting Room)

(Several hours later. Inside the ES Building, the meeting room.) 

**Eichi**: Well done on the photo shoot, everyone. Up next is an interview recording according to the idols gracing the cover of the “ES Idol Directory.”  

I’ve prepared the questions in advance, so it would be helpful if you looked at this paper in advance. Here you go.  

**Rei**: Hm……. “The reason for becoming an idol,” “this year’s goals,” “jobs that make you feel fulfilled”— 

Tenshouin-kun. Honestly, these questions are quite boring, aren’t they? 

**Eichi**: Yes, they are.

**Rei**: Dont just say “yes”. Then, are you trying to pester us? 

**Eichi**: Fufu. I’m not going to pester you on a project for external use. 

I’m sure these questions are all unremarkable and something you’ve heard a million times before. 

But even so, these questions are a precious gateway for those who would like to get to know you for the first time. 

Above all else, it will serve as an opportunity to pitch the earnest and sincere side of ES idols. 

You probably think it’s trivial, but it’s very important.

**Nagisa**: …… Hm. I understand what you want to say, but… 

…… These kinds of questions have little significance to the interview. It’s something that could just be answered in questionnaire form. 

…… I think it would be dificult to develop a discussion based on this, and it would be hard to create an impressive article from it. 

…… If the main point of the directory is the idol directory and the interview is simply an element to liven things up, then it wouldn’t matter. 

…… But, if you want it to be an article that’s memorable to the reader, then don’t you need to think up something? 

**Eichi**: Think up, huh…… Your bonds don’t seem to be deep enough to the extent that you could surely compensate for it with conversation.  

If you deepen your bonds a little before taking part in the interview, it seems like it would be a more interesting article. 

Hmm\~mm…… Shall we prepare some kind of activity? For example——

An all-out hunt for a white snake? 

# The Coming of Dreams, Encircling Fate Six

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/cg17.png">

(Location: Forest)

(Several days later)

**Tetora**: —— And then, the group visited the legendary “Nameless Mountain” where the white snake was said to live. 

**Nagisa**: …… It has a legend, but it’s a “Nameless Mountain” huh?

**Tetora**: It hurts when you jab back at that….. This mountain is under the Tenshouin household’s ownership, so it seems that it has no name. 

**Nagisa**: …… I see. In that case, just for the time being, why don’t we try to name it? 

….. Like maybe “Ensemble Mountain”, naming it after ES. 

**Izumi**: Ensemble? Don’t you think it doesn’t fit in with this forest’s atmosphere? 

**Nagisa**: …… No. When the bean paste falls, your writing trembles, it becomes “Ensemble Mountain”.(1)  

**Eichi**: Uwaa, what terrible alternate reading♪ 

**Izumi**: Why does he look so happy…… I’m rejecting that way of calling it. Call it “Mountain” like normal, just “Mountain”. 

So anyway Nagumo. Why are you using a camera? 

**Eichi**: I asked him to. I did say “If you’re going to go searching for the white snake, you better go with Tetora-kun” to Nagisa-kun. 

**Izumi**: I heard about that while we were leaving. What I want to know is why you’re making a recording of this. 

**Eichi**: Ah. This sort of expedition is best experienced at the actual place, but if you make a record of it, you’ll be able to have fun looking back at them right? 

One day, I might do a project like this. I thought I’d take some footage as reference material. 

**Izumi**: Is that so. I don’t really care, but don’t involve me in that, okay?

**Rei**: Kukuku. If we were in a variety show, that would be a huge thing to pretend about, you know? 

**Izumi**: I’m not pretending!

**Rei**: Putting that aside. Tenshouin-kun, is the white snake really inhabiting this mountain? 

**Eichi**: Yes, it’s here. I’ve been preparing just for today♪ 

**Hokuto**: You’ve been preparing? Does it not live here? 

**Eichi**: This mountain is large, and a normal snake would be moving around. 

But. Rather than searching without knowing if it exists or not, you’d surely be able to find a white snake that has been released prior to this, right? 

**Hokuto**: That’s true, but…… This idea is like goldfish scooping at the night market, or fishing at the a pond in the fish hatchery. 

**Nagisa**: …… Yeah. It feels awkward to damage the ecosystem just for us. 

**Eichi**: It’s fine. Because I trust that you all will get it back properly. 

Of course it’s non-toxic, and taking the safety aspect into account, security cameras have been installed in various places so I’d like you to search with confidence. 

**Rei**: You’re the one having the most fun for no reason aren’t you, Tenshouin-kun? 

**Eichi**: Fufu. From a safe zone, I’ll be carefully appreciating your movements through the camera Nagumo-kun is holding. In other words, I will be the “audience”. 

Also, after that—

**Rei**: There’s still more? But I want to start looking for the snake. 

**Eichi**: I get it. Please bear with me and listen for just a little bit more. 

Your search for the white snake is not simply for having fun, but it is also for you to mingle with each other. 

Even though I said that, there is not enough tension in the four of you searching together. 

**Hokuto**: I think there’s no need for any tension?

**Eichi**: However, that’s where it’s more exciting isn’t it? That’s why you should split into two-person pairs— 

Whichever of you finds the white snake first will win the battle. 

**Izumi**: Haah? Can we stop with the pairing thing. Of course being alone with someone you’re not really close to is gonna be uncomfortable. 

**Eichi**: Is that so. So you’re going to catch the white snake by yourself when you encounter it then, Sena-kun? 

**Izumi**: That’s…… 

………

……. Then? Who’ll be pairing up with me?

**Eichi**: I’ll have Sena-kun team up with Hokuto. 

**Izumi**: Hidaka~? You, don’t you go holding me back, got it? 

**Hokuto**: Hmph. That should be my line. 

**Rei**: Which means I’ll be with Ran-kun then. 

**Nagisa**: …… Mm. I’ll be counting on you, Sakuma-kun. 

**Eichi**: Now then, let’s start the adventure immediately. Idols should be a refined and beautiful being on stage—

But right now, I’d like you to find the white snake while covered in sweat and dirt……♪ 

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/cg19.png">

(One hour later. With the Izumi and Hokuto pair)

**Hokuto**: ………

**Izumi**: ………

…… Come on. Talk about something.

**Hokuto**: Even if you tell me to…. Chatting diffuses your attention, so we might accidentally overlook the white snake. 

**Izumi**: Come on, an awkward silence would make it worse for efficiency. You’re the kouhai here, you should be more thoughtful. 

**Hokuto**: We’ve both graduated from Yumenosaki Academy. Stop making a big deal of your seniority all the time.(2) 

**Izumi**: There, a contradiction~. You keep calling me senpai, but you still say that? 

**Hokuto**: Hmph…… 

**Izumi**: See, see, you can’t say anything back to me right? Why don’t you just obediently say “I’m sorry, senpai”? 

**Hokuto**: …… What a bother. I get it, I’ll just sloppily throw down a topic, so satisfy yourself with that. 

A chat huh…… Speaking of which, I feel like I’ve seen this scenery somewhere before. 

**Izumi**: Aren’t you just imagining things?  It’s just a dense forest. 

**Hokuto**: Maybe so. But I’ve finally managed to wring out this topic, so stop cutting me off. 

**Izumi**: Okay okay, I get it. What’s the rest? 

**Hokuto**: …… I’ve remembered; it was around winter. 

One day, Hibiki-senpai kidnapped me. When I woke up, I was locked up in a mountain hut. 

**Izumi**: A mountain hut? Why? 

**Hokuto**: It was under the pretext of a training camp for theater. However, half of it it was something more like going along with that guy’s whims.

Anyhow. The scenery I saw when I left that mountain hut felt like this. 

At that time, Hibiki-senpai said “When I was talking a walk, I found a convenient unoccupied house”. I couldn’t even fathom what sort of walking route that would be…… 

Now, the story is finally coming together. If that mountain was the Tenshouin family’s domain, it would all come together. 

**Izumi**: Hmm……. So does that mean you’re familiar with this area? 

**Hokuto**: To some degree. That said, at the time, my head was full of getting off the mountain so I didn’t have the leeway to look around. 

Hmmm…… It looks like the animal trail I used at that time. If we descend on this path, we will eventually get out to find a settlement. 

**Izumi**: A settlement? People live this deep in the mountains? 

**Hokuto**: No, it’s a werewolf settlement. If you make eye contact, they’ll attack you. 

**Izumi**: You must be joking!? That’s more trouble than the white snake, so I definitely don’t want to get close……! 

If we come across them, I’m going to use you as a decoy and I’m going to run as fast as I can. 

**Hokuto**: Oh dear. What a pathetic statement. One wouldn’t think you’re a senpai. 

**Izumi**: What’s with that, suuper annoying! 

<br>

TL NOTES:
<ol>
<li>餡が散って震えると書いて、『餡散震(あんさんぶる)山』: Nagisa is actually explaining how he thought up the name by making a little one word story out of it. By combining the three kanji 餡(Bean paste) 散(fall) 震(tremble), it becomes 餡散震 and this can be read as An-san-buru (Ensemble). This is an application of Ateji, that is using alternate kanji reading and sometimes prioritising the reading over the meaning. Yeah… Thanks, Nagisa.</li>
<li>先輩風 (SenpaiFu): lit. senior wind. Kind of like pulling rank, but the only rank you have is being there longer or being older in terms of age.</li>

# The Coming of Dreams, Encircling Fate Seven

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/cg21.png">

(Location: Forest)

**Tetora**: —Tenshouin-senpai, d’you hear me? It’s Tetora Nagomu here on the scene! 

I’m currently secretly tracking down Hidaka-senpai and Sena-senpai! It looks like they’re possibly heading towards a werewolf village! 

**Eichi**: “Werewolf? …… Ah, the training camp? The staff withdrew a very long time ago, so there’s no one there. 

…… Ah, but the white snake could be there. I can’t predict how ‘that’ will move.” 

**Tetora**: Woah. Hidaka-senpai slipped down here! 

Buuuut, Sena-senpai is close behind! And he avoided falling over, how admirable! 

**Eichi**: “…… Hey, Nagumo-kun. Your play-by-play is awfully enthusiastic, don’t you think?” 

**Tetora**: Yessir! I cultivated this style through the Ryuuousen! 

And, it earned the boss’s approval~♪ The world of advanced competition is a man’s world! It’s sacred and unencroachable……☆ 

**Eichi**: “Is that so? It’s good that you’re feeling energetic, but it would be helpful if you could lower your voice a little. 

If you make a ruckus, Hokuto and the others will probably notice.”  

**Tetora**: I’m not being loud? This is my normal volume! 

**Eichi**: “…… Uh huh. That normal voice is quite loud though.” 

**Tetora**: Hehe♪ But something like that is awesome for conveying the vibes! I’ll be careful not to overload the sound! 

**Eichi**: “Alright then. I’m glad your handling this with such enthusiasm, but……  Well, coordinate your voice this way”

**Tetora**: I’ll be sure to! Wait, huh……? 

Hidaka-senpai and Sena-senpai have gone on the move! I’ll run after them quickly! 

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/cg22.png">

(Meanwhile, with the Nagisa and Rei pair)

**Nagisa**: …… The white snake, it’s not anywhere.

**Rei**: Yeah. We can’t find a single soul out here, let alone a snake. 

According to Tenshouin-kun, a white snake was released. I wonder just how many there are? 

**Nagisa**: …… There are more than one? 

**Rei**: It’s only natural to come to that thought. It’d be backbreaking work to find a single one here on such an expansive mountain. 

However,if there were hundreds of them……  In that case I’d like to refrain. 

**Nagisa**: ……. I see. Well, it’s a normal fear, isn’t it. Considering the goal, I think it wouldn’t be as we expect.  

………

…… The Mystery Researchers Club searches for legendary creatures, right? Have you ever found one?  

**Rei**: Unfortunately, we have…… Not, we unfortunately have not. 

As you know, the Mystery Researchers Club’s activities are seeking out sacred sites and legendary creatures.

Discovery is not the only purpose. The most important thing is the process of finding it.

It’s enjoyable to rely on unclear information, with everyone saying this and that while searching out in the field. Precisely like we are now. 

No matter the result, as long as you made happy memories then it’s successful. 

**Nagisa**: …… Happy memories, huh. 

**Rei**: Kukuku. Now that I think about it, we were previously deceived by Saegusa-kun’s smooth talk♪(1) 

**Nagisa**: …… Ibara’s smooth talk? Did he put an idea into your head?

**Rei**: Indeed. He informed us of a rumour that “If you pick up trash along the beach in the dead of night, a kappa will appear out of thin air.” 

It truly caught on with us and so we worked hard cleaning all throughout the night. And in the end, we didn’t meet a kappa. 

At the crack of dawn, Saegusa-kun came along and told use he was going to use it for an Adam photoshoot, and that’s when we understood the truth of the situation. 

**Nagisa**: …… I’ll scold Ibara, after I get back. 

**Rei**: There’s no need. It was last year, so I don’t care now. 

And didn’t I tell you? If we make happy memories then it was a success. 

Perhaps on that day we may not have been able to see a kappa. 

However, the morning glow from the beautiful beach with not a single piece of trash was a moment that’s hard to come by no matter the generation.  

Even if we don’t find the snake today— 

In this way, for us, who have a very shallow relationship and were given a chance to form a deeper bond by searching for the snake, it’s a pleasant memory we can talk about. 

Although we appeared together in La Mort, we hardly had the chance to talk to each other one-on-one like this. 

**Nagisa**: …… Yeah. But it’s too soon to talk about things in summary. 

…… Because I haven’t given up yet. 

**Rei**: Of course, I haven’t as well. The hunt has only just begun. 

Then, how about we put our backs into it and search for the lucky white snake that guided as here……♪

# The Coming of Dreams, Encircling Fate Eight

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/cg23.png">

(Location: Forest)

(A little while later)

**Nagisa**: …… I can’t hear anything that isn’t our footsteps, to say nothing of a snake.

**Rei**: Yes. I like the silence, but for it to be no sounds at all like this is eerie. It feels like searching for a lost child at this rate. 

**Nagisa**: …… If I knew this would happen, I would have mastered the snake flute. 

**Rei**: Kukuku. When I imagine it, it surprisingly fits you♪ 

If it’s drawn to sounds, I’d try to use my beautiful voice. But I’m tired, so I’ll let the matter pass. 

**Nagisa**: ...... We have been walking for a while. Shall we stop for a bit? 

**Rei**: Yes. Let’s rest our lower backs on that rock. Hup……♪ 

Fu……. We walked for a long while. I feel like my sense of time is going to be messed up because we keep seeing the same sort of scenery. 

**Nagisa**: ……. Our sense of direction too. I remember where we came from, but I don’t know the compass directions. 

**Rei**: Yes. It’s said that you can guess the time and the compass directions from the position of the sun. But with all these overgrown trees, we can’t see the all-important sun. 

**Nagisa**: ……. At this rate, it feels like we’re just circling around the same places. 

….. That is to say. Since we’re unable to accurately understand the size of the mountain, we may have already been going around in circles. 

…… Hm?

**Rei**: Ran-kun, what is it? 

**Nagisa**: Over there. I see an empty dark space in between the trees. 

**Rei**: Ooh, a cave. It’s starting to develop even more into an adventure. 

How interesting. Let’s go and take a look immediately. 

**Nagisa**: …… Is your fatigue gone? Are you really okay? 

**Rei**: Yes. I was just growing weary of the same scenery; I’m fine. My vitality has welled up in one go♪ 

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/cg24.png">

(Location: Abandoned Mine)

**Rei**: ...... I see. It’s not as I expected. 

**Nagisa**: …… It’s a cave, after all. Sakuma-kun, are you not good with the dark? 

**Rei**: No way. If anything, it’s my specialty. Even though I don’t look it, I’m the King of Demons who rule over the dead of night. 

It’s just……. It seems I have a tendency to be liked by bats. They become attached to me like dogs do. 

I wouldn’t mind if it’s just a few of them. But on a deserted island(1), my whole body looked pitch black by them hanging around me. That was a troublesome time.  

**Nagisa**: …….A deserted island? Did you go there for a Mystery Researchers club activity? ……

**Rei**: No. A job…… no, if I were to say it, it’s closer to a vacation. 

When I went to Nankoku, the four members of Undead, who had heard of the “Mermaid legend”, came to investigate. 

But in the end, we found out that the mermaid’s identity was a dugong. 

But the view of the creek untouched by human hands was oh so picturesque. It was definitely worth the disaster. 

**Nagisa**: ……Disaster? 

**Rei**: Oops. For the details, please ask Kaoru-kun some other day. 

Anyhow. I’m glad that this cave doesn’t seem to have bats. 

This stillness and atmosphere makes it seem like there’s going to be treasure……♪ 

**Nagisa**: ……Fufu, you’re right. But I’d be happier with the white snake over the treasure. 

……Eh? I can hear noisy footsteps. 

**Rei**: Yes. It’s from the inner part of the cave……Oya?

**Hokuto**: ——Over here, Sena-senpai! 

**Izumi**: I know! You better not lose sight of it! 

**Nagisa**: ……. It’s Hokuto-kun and Izumi-kun. Hello there. 

**Hokuto**: My apologies, this isn’t the time for leisurely greetings. Right now, we’ve cornered the white snake—— 

…… Or we should have. It seems that we’ve lost sight of it. 

**Izumi**: Ha!? I told you you better not lose sight of it! This is the worst…… 

**Hokuto**: Even if you say that, the opponent is a swift snake. It can’t be helped that tracking it would be difficult. 

However, our haul is cornering it into the cavern. It’s easier to find it here than in the middle of the mountain where there are lots of obstacles.  

Ran-senpai, Sakuma-senpai. Did you catch sight of the white snake? 

**Nagisa**: …… No, we didn’t. 

**Hokuto**: Is that so. That’s unfortunate. 

…… Mm? There’s a small hole in the wall. Maybe this is where it escaped. 

**Izumi**: It’s true. It looks like that snake can get through. Man, it’s so cheeky even though it’s just a snake~ 

**Rei**: Snakes are also the symbol of cunning, you see. You might not be able to deal with it by normal means.

However, you say you’ve witnessed the white snake. We’re finally getting to the climax, aren’t we Ran-kun? 

**Nagisa**: ……Mm. Let’s focus so that we won’t even miss the smallest of sounds. 

**Hokuto**: It should still be close. Sena-senpai, what do you say we continue the search together with Sakuma-senpai and Ran-senpai? 

**Izumi**: What are you saying. Are you trying to forget about the rules? If we caught the white snake just now we’d have won—— which means that these guys are our rivals. 

**Hokuto**: But the opponent is a snake. It can move around nimbly, and we can’t read it’s thoughts. It’s better to have more people. 

**Nagisa**: ……. First, all four of us will look, and we find it, we can compete to catch it either individually or by pair. The pair that catches it win…… How about that? 

**Hokuto**: Yeah. I was thinking of making that same suggestion. It would be easier to find it if we cooperate. 

**Izumi**: No no, it’s more efficient to split up, right? 

It’s harder to move with more people, and anyway what do you think you’re doing with everyone gathered in this tiny space? 

**Hokuto**: Sena-senpai’s opinion has some truth to it. But the cave is dark, and its roads are complicated. In the unlikely event that you get lost, it’ll be difficult to search for you.

**Izumi**: Lost? I’m not a child, I’m telling you I’ll be fine. 

**Nagisa**: …… The inside of the cave is more complicated than expected, and there is no telling where the white snake would be hiding in. 

…… It’s safer to move as four, and won’t it be easier to handle it when we find it, Izumi-kun? 

**Rei**: Yes. We shouldn’t focus on winning or losing, it’s more important that we can find it safely. 

Rather, isn’t always aiming for efficiency linked to failure? 

**Izumi**: What’s with this feeling like I’m being scolded….. I get it I get it. We just have to move as four. 

…… Hm? I feel like that small rock just moved——

(Location: Abandoned Mine)

(10 minutes later)

**Izumi**:――I found it! Hidaka, over here!  
**Hokuto**: Where? 

**Izumi**: I said over there! Come onnn, you’ll lose sight of it if you don’t hurry up! 

**Hokuto**: Gh…… If you’re going to go there then you should help out too. 

**Izumi**: What are you saying? I’m leading you like this, aren’t I?

I don’t want to touch a snake. So be my hands and feet and do your best, okayy?

**Rei**: Hm. So in that pair, it’s essentially only Hidaka-kun working. 

In which case—― 

**Hokuto**: Wha!? Oi, what are you doing! Let go! 

**Rei**: Kukuku. It’s an impossible discussion♪ 

Look, Ran-kun! Catch the snake before it’s too late! 

**Nagisa**: …… Alright. Leave it to me. 

…… I’ve been observing the snake, and I have a general understanding of its movements.

…… If you calmly, anticipate——  

…… I caught it.

**Rei**: Well done, Ran-kun♪ 

Hmm? Somehow, the white snake’s appearance has changed, hasn’t it? 

**Nagisa**: ………! It became a bundle of thread. 

……… No, not a thread. This is—— 

**Wataru**: Amazing, it’s your very own Wataru Hibiki!  What Nagisa-kun grabbed is actually, ta da\~! It was the very hair on my head☆  

**Hokuto**: …… He appeared. 

**Izumi**: Uwah, this is the worst. 

**Wataru**: Oya oya? What a boring reaction. If you don’t act more surprised my heart will burst. Sob sob sob…… 

Now now, Black Kid-kun! Come here and caputre my tears up close! 

**Tetora**: O-On it! 

**Wataru**: Everyone, how did you find your adventure in search of the white snake? Was it fun? 

There’ll be a special service for everyone who worked up a sweat and gave it their all in pursuing the white snake! 

Before your very eyes, watch as my hair moves like a snake! Wiggle wiggle\~☆ 

**Izumi**: Ugh, gross! What is he, Medusa? 

**Rei**: He’s as skillful a man as ever. 

**Nagisa**: …… Wataru-kun, how is it moving? 

**Wataru**: Fufufu. That’s a trade secret. If I were to bring the trick to light, you would wake up from your dreams………………♪ 

Next, bring your attention here☆ I shall cast a spell upon this here ordinary cloth. Abracadabra——One, two, Amazing✩

**Eichi**: Hello, everyone. You’ve worked hard. What a sight– it seems you’ve caught the white snake. 

**Nagisa**: ……… In other words, the white snake’s true form was Wataru-kun?

**Eichi**: Yes. To be more precise, it’s Wataru’s hair. It was modelled into the white snake so it could more suitably come into contact with you. 

Even if it’s not poisonous, I can’t be so irresponsible as to release snakes into the wild. 

Within an unfamiliar environment, they sometimes cooperate and sometimes compete.  As intended, everyone became better acquainted with each other, right? 

This will also make conversation move ahead smoothly. If you like, you may raise the topic of today’s events. 

Oops, I forgot to say something important. Sakuma-kun, Nagisa-kun, congratulations on finding the white snake♪ 

**Nagisa**: …… Yes, thank you. 

**Rei**: Oya. Rather than a prize, do you intend for us to make due with just words? Despite being a wealthy person, you’re somewhat cheap.  

**Eichi**: Hm……. Since it was an activity done for the sake of an article, I didn’t plan to prepare a reward, but— 

I’ve enjoyed your performance today, so I will personally provide a reward. Anything you want, I’ll grant your wish. 

**Rei**: Oh? Since you’re the one offering, when you say “anything” I’m all the more at a loss. 

What about you, Ran-kun? Do you have a wish you want granted?

**Nagisa**: ……. Please wait a moment. I’m trying to think. 

………

…… Ah. I’ve got a good idea.

(Location: Okinawa Townscape)

(Later. A certain place in Okinawa) 

**Kanata**:  Everyone from the “Mystery Researchers Club”\~, welcome to “Okinawa”\~♪. Greeti\~ngs.(1)

**Tsumugi**: Ahaha. Even though we came here together, when you put it like that, you sound like a local\~  

**Kanata**: Fufufu. It’s because I have “family ties” in “Okinawa.” 

If you get into trouble, please “call” for me. I will ask everyone in “Ryuseitai” to help you out by “smartphone.” 

**Rei**: You’re relying on your unitmates are you?

**Kanata**: Yes, since I’m not familiar with the surface.  

Chiaki and the others will become my “power.” One for all and all for one……♪ 

**Makoto**: Waah, that’s reassuring♪ But I’m sure we’ll be fine. I’ve done a ton of research on Okinawa’s tourist attractions and sacred sites for today. 

Nagisa-san, don’t hesitate to ask me anything! 

**Nagisa**: …… I will, thank you. 

…… In any case, I didn’t think he would grant that kind of wish. Is what I was trying to say.  

**Rei**: Is that what you thought? Weren’t you the one to demand that of Tenshouin-kun, though? 

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. But I thought he would say no or bring up an alternative. 

“…… I want to participate in the Mystery Researchers Club’s activities as a guest. And I want you to pay for every circle member’s travel expenses.”  

…… Extravagant requests like that usually don’t get accepted. 

**Nazuna**: If it’s Tenshouin then he wouldn’t refuse. To a guy like him, our travel expenses are the same as buying penny candy. 

They say “food tastes better when someone else is paying,” and traveling using Tenshouin’s money is the best too~

Heehee. Since he’s taking on the cost for the entire stay, I’ll buy lots of souvenirs with the money I saved♪ 

**Rei**: I intend to do so as well. My unitmates gave me a list of souvenirs they want me to bring back. 

Now then. While we head to our lodging to drop off our luggage, let’s decide on a sightseeing route. 

**Nagisa**: …… Alright. This is a rare opportunity, so I’d like to discuss it and come to a decision. 
**Tsumugi**: Yea\~h. Okinawa really is a charming place, isn’t it. It’s difficult to decide where to go. 

**Kanata**: There’s lots of “sacred sites” and “places of note.” The “temples” and “gusuku”(2) are also good—

You can’t miss the “ocean” or “aquarium” either♪

**Nazuna**: The ocean sounds great\~. It seems to be a tourist attraction, and the Okinawan ocean has a special feel to it! 

**Makoto**: Then, how about we go to the beach first, and after that tour around the nearby tourist spot? 

**Nagisa**: …… Sounds good.  The white sandy beaches and the bright blue sky and ocean. I can’t wait to see them with my own eyes. 

**Rei**: Mhm. Welcome, Ran-kun, to the Mystery Researchers club. 

Come with us on a risky journey filled with mystery……♪

TL NOTES:
<ol>
<li>Kanata says two variations of “welcome” in this sentence, first “ようこそ” (youkoso) which is standard Japanese for a general welcome and then “めんそ~れ” (menso~re) which is the Ryuukyuu language equivalent to “いらっしゃいませ” (irasshaimase), the respectful version of welcome in standard Japanese which is often said by store or restaurant staff when a customer enters.</li>
<li>Gusuku is the word for Okinawan castles or fortresses in the Ryuukyuu language.</li>

# The Coming of Dreams, Encircling Fate Ten

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/cg27.png">

(Location: Café COCHI)

(Some days even later. The week after the “ES Idol Directory” goes on sale.) 

**Eichi**: Everyone. Thank you again for lending your help. Thanks to you, we were able to make a wonderful directory. 

**Rei**: Getting praise from Tenshouin-kun is weirdly creepy(1). Leave the flattery at that. 

**Eichi**: It’s not flattery. The gravure(2) on the front is received well by the world. 

I almost couldn’t believe it’s the same people who ran around a mountain to look for the white snake. Fufu♪ 

**Tetora**: The talk interview article is really good too. It seems fun, and even then, there seems to be stuff I can relate to. I read it all in one go. 

Every single photo really was perfect! I got a new goal: one day, I want to be an idol who could be displayed on the cover of the directory too! 

**Eichi**: What splendid enthusiasm. I’m surprised it resonated with you as well, Nagumo-kun.

Just as the name suggests, this “ES Idol Directory” is jam-packed with the latest information of ES Idols.

That aspect might not feel that fresh to us active idols. 

However, to new idols, or to little ones aiming to become idols, it might be a single volume packed with dreams and hopes. 

What you’ve said in the talk interviews—— I’m sure there are little ones who admire those experiences and words and embrace them, using them to prop them up for the future. 

Fufu. I feel like Sena-kun would say that “It’s annoying when my rivals multiply”.  

**Izumi**: You, aren’t you looking down on me? I’m not going to be flustered over something like that. 

No matter how many stardust multiply, in the end, they’re still stardust. But it’s going to be different if they could emit true brilliance. 

Still, I have the self confidence that I will be able to keep my composure and be ready for it, because I plan to have the strength to back it up.

**Hokuto**: I couldn’t believe this is coming from someone who declared that his hobby is “Teasing juniors”. 

**Izumi**: Your information’s old, you know? …….See, look at this. 

**Hokuto**: …… Your hobbies are “Health management, cycling”? 

**Izumi**: Each agency did a profile renewal due to the production of the “ES Idol Directory” didn’t they? That’s when it was erased.

**Hokuto**: I see. But the past that you did tease juniors itself couldn’t be erased. 

**Izumi**: Shut up. What about you? 

**Hokuto**: You mean about my hobbies? They’re “Movie appreciation, Crossword puzzles”. 

Appearing on Fist of Idol; Togenkyo was the impetus for me to watch movies more frequently, so I added “Movie appreciation”. 

**Rei**: Oh. You’re matching with me. 

**Hokuto**: Did we clash? …… I kind of feel bad because it feels like our info(3) clashed. Can we change it even if it’s late? 

**Eichi**: It’s impossible. How could we reprint just for your sake?

If you change the information registered in your agency, it would look like the directory has a misprint. Accept it graciously. 

Don’t worry about it. Compared to the amount of people who put in ‘Reading’ as their hobby, not many people are clashing with you.  

**Rei**: Don’t say any more than that, Tenshouin-kun. You’re going to hurt me, who wrote down both ‘Reading and ‘Movie appreciation’ as my hobbies. 

**Eichi**: But you’re not that sensitive♪ Look at our Wataru’s(4) hobby section and cheer up. 

**Nagisa**: …… Wataru-kun has a variety of hobbies. It’s wonderful. 

**Tetora**: It feels like he wrote as much as he could think of with how much he wrote~ 

......Eh? It feels like Ran-senpai’s specialty is different from before. 

U\~myu. I don’t remember what it is specifically. But if I remember correctly, it feels like it wasn’t acting……?

**Nagisa**: ……. Mm. I previously wrote “Can do anything”. To give off a sense of omnipotence. 

...... But I changed it, because there are a lot of things I don’t know. 

...... All things considered, you did well to notice, didn’t you? 

**Tetora**: Because it had a strong impact on me. So much so that even when I couldn’t remember the details, I just slightly remember it. 

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Spring/cg29.png">

**Nagisa**: ……. Oh yeah. I have souvenirs for Tetora-kun and everyone else.

**Tetora**: Souvenirs? …… Ah, from the Mystery Researchers! 

**Nagisa**: …… Mm. Kanata-kun said the kids from Ryuseitai have been to Okinawa, so I thought a normal souvenir would be no good. 

...... I made Shisa(5) statues with everyone’s faces on them. 

**Eichi**: Shisa statues with our faces on them. 

**Rei**: Kukuku. I did gently suggest a different souvenir, you know? But he said that “Something unique is better”, so I couldn’t suggest too strongly. 

**Eichi**: Is that so? Since it’s you, you could have thought it was funny and didn’t stop him. 

**Tetora**: …… Oh. The Shisa is from the neck downwards, but the face itself is me. 

**Izumi**: Mm, it looks like a exact copy so it’s scary. Did you not think to like, deform(6) it a little? 

**Nagisa**: ……. No. Because I paid attention on them being true to life. 

...... Shisa also hold meaning as a ward against evil, you see. It seems that it protects the house where it displayed on the roof at. 

....... I’d like everyone to display it in your rooms. 

**Hokuto**: What about your sacred site visits? Did you feel something? 

**Rei**: Geez. Young people nowadays always want quick results. Change won’t call on you that easily.

**Nagisa**: …… At the beginning, it was the white snake dream. When searching for it in the courtyard, Tetora-kun and Sakuma-kun joined me, and it led towards a new job…….

....... Unexpectedly, we ended up going to Okinawa. Thinking back about it, it feels like everything was connected. 

...... Being able to experience new things is thanks to good fortune. I want to believe that something will happen again. 

...... I will work as hard as I can so I don’t fail to notice that ‘something’.

...... So that I don’t embarrass myself as an idol displayed on the cover of the directory.
