(Location: Shuuetsu Hallway)

**Nagisa**: …… Um, Anzu-san?

…… Ah, that’s good. I wasn’t mistaken about your name.

…… To meet you in a place like this– what are you doing here alone?

> Option 1: Actually, I got lost……

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… Is that so? Then we’re in this predicament together.

…… Yes, I’m lost as well.

…… It shouldn’t be so vast. It’s far too easy to get lost in this school.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… Where do you need to go? Hopefully it’s somewhere I can navigate to.

…… Yes, I’ll show you the way. When I visited Yumenosaki Academy, I remember you helped guide me to the student council room.

…… It’s a good thing to help and be kind to each other.

> Option 2: I came to watch the lesson 

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… Lesson? Whose lesson?

…… Ah, I see. Those children from Yumenosaki are here, right?

…… Sorry, I couldn’t remember it properly. I need to refresh my memory with the materials Ibara prepared for me.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… I see. To meet you again like this, it must be fate.

…… I was a little surprised, I only recall there being those children from Trickstar being here yesterday. 

…… Ah, thank you very much. I apologize for greeting you so late, it’s nice to meet you here.

(Location: Shuuetsu Academy front gates)

**Nagisa**: …… Ah, we meet again.

…… Just now, who was I talking to? I’m not quite sure who that was.

…… I see… Someone you don’t know. I was approached there and asked to answer a questionnaire.

> Option 1: So what happened?

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… I tried to answer it, but since I couldn’t understand what it was asking I could hardly come up with answers.

…… What is the meaning behind the questions? What is the significance of soliciting the survey in the first place? Then I asked him about what his purpose in life was…

…… For some reason, he suddenly remembered he had something to do and left.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: “Fuhahahaha! What a stupid question! Bow your head and apologize!”

…… I forgot to act in character again. I forgot about it earlier, too.

…… I remembered and tried to say the same line as I just said, but it seemed to surprise him and he ran away.

> Option 2: Was it a catch sale?

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… I suppose so. The purpose of what I was being asked earlier must have been to get me to buy something expensive.

…… It’s fine, though. I almost finished the questionnaire but I never signed it. 

…… Ibara told me it’d be best if I didn’t sign anything unless it was for work.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… What is a catch?

…… Huh? Did I say something funny?

…… Sorry. Without Ibara, it’s difficult to express myself properly.

# Episode 3

(Location: Shuuetsu hallway at night)

**Nagisa**: …… Ah– Anzu-san. Have you seen Tsumugi around here?

…… We were together not long ago but before I knew it we were separated.

…… I shouldn’t have gazed out that window.

> Option 1: Should I contact him?

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… Ah, I see… I could have contacted him with a smartphone.

…… I find it troublesome to operate so I often forget it exists.

…… I have one but I’m hopeless at using it. Sorry, could you contact him for me?

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… Yes, it’d be helpful if you could do that.

…… I’m not in trouble, but it’s likely Tsumugi-kun is.

…… I hope he wasn’t left behind in the bathroom or something like that.

> Option 2: What was outside the window?

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… The stars were shining beautifully tonight.

…… A romanticist? I don’t understand what makes you see me that way but when compared to Ibara I suppose you have a point.

…… It seems that we all have different values.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… Nothing. I was just wondering if it was already nighttime.

…… Were you working so hard on your lesson that you lost track of time?

…… No, I had almost entirely free time today. Rather than losing track of time through lessons, I got lost in my excavation work.
