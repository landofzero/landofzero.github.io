(Location: Adam’s Private Room)

**Nagisa**: “Fuhahahaha! Kneel, you imbeciles! Before the brilliance of……”

…… Hm? It says to use my hand movements to exaggerate the delivery.

…… That wasn’t written there before. You’ve done your research thoroughly, Ibara.

> Option 1: Excuse me for interrupting your lesson.

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… It seems I’ve reached the time quota.

…… Ibara creates schedules for me so I try to follow it and do my lessons and training.

…… Once it’s completed, the rest of the day is free time. I wonder if I’ll spend it reading a book today.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… Anzu-san, what do you need?

…… Well, why are you apologizing? You don’t need to leave now.

…… Ah, I’m sorry. If I look angry it’s because I’m practicing my character.

> Option 2: Err~……

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: “Kneel, you imbeciles! Before the brilliance of Ran Nagisa!”

…… Yes, let’s go with that. (Victory pose)

…… One more time. Let’s start from where I laugh loudly…

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… Ah, it’s Anzu-san. Good afternoon.

…… Did you come to pick up the luggage you left here?

…… I see. Sorry, I have difficulty expressing myself. It’s okay to enter without permission.

(Location: Adam’s Private Room)

**Nagisa**: …… What does “Hokke~mi” mean?

…… That’s what I heard Akehoshi Subaru of Trickstar say, and Ibara gladly told me.

…… It seems Ibara was deemed “Bari~,” he has some interesting sensibilities.

> Option 1: Everyone is unique.

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… Incidentally, how is that child faring? The one I spoke to on the first day.

…… Ah, you came to have a lesson today too, right?

…… I see. Trickstar seems to finally be living up to the image Hiyori-kun described to me.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… By “everyone” do you mean everyone in Trickstar?

…… I don’t quite get it. Yes, I don’t understand it at all.

…… But it’s interesting *because* I don’t know. I think that and archaeology are the same.

> Option 2: You could ask next time.

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… I wonder what they’ll say about me, or rather, what they’ll call me.

…… Ibara is amusing himself with his schemes.

…… I’m curious to see if they will exceed our expectations.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. Hiyori-kun had also praised them, so I’d like to speak with them more.

…… Hiyori-kun also seems to have a strange sensibility.

…… To him, most things can either be classified as “fine weather” or “foul weather.”

(Location: Adam’s Autumn Live Stage)

**Nagisa**: ………

…… Okay. Wait a moment, Ibara. I’ll be back in a little while.

…… Huh? It’s Anzu-san— I thought you were Ibara.

> Option 1: The live is starting soon.

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… Oh right, today is the day Autumn Live will happen. I don’t know what you’re talking about “wearing a costume.”

…… Ah–! I’m in costume.

…… Alright, I’m not dirty. If I were to get thrown in the tub right now, I would be able to make it on time to the actual performance as expected.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… I wonder if Ibara told you to come here.

…… No? It seemed like he was looking for me, so did you offer to help?

…… You’re kind, Anzu-san. I wish all living creatures could have such a spirit.

> Option 2: I’ve been calling for you for a while……

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… I’m sorry. When I started thinking about the possibility of there being hidden underneath the ground here, I couldn’t stop myself.

…… Thank you very much for calling me.

…… Any longer and I would have started a full-scale excavation.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… Is that so? I hadn’t noticed.

…… If it were Ibara, he’d call out to me loudly and arrive in a tank so I’d know right away.

…… Ah, sorry. You’re not Ibara. Most normal people wouldn’t do that.
