(Location: Animal Pens)

**Nagisa**: …… Ah, Anzu=san. Why do you seem out of breath?

…… Ibara’s looking for me? I see. Then it’d be best if I went back.

…… What was I doing? I was looking at the animals in the pen.

> Option 1: Can you pet the animals?

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… I wonder if they’ll bite me if I try to pet them.

…… I don’t mind if I get hurt, but Ibara will be worried if I do get bitten.

…… Will it be fine if I ask Ibara if I can pet it? If I get permission then I can pet as I please.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… I wonder if it’s okay to pet them.

…… By touching them, I could gain more information than simple observation can provide.

…… But it’s almost the time I promised to meet with Ibara at, so I’ll have to do it next time.

> Option 2: Do you like animals?

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… Yes, perhaps I do like them.

…… Animals cannot speak or understand language, so what are they thinking, I wonder?

…… But it’s interesting specifically because I don’t know. I think there’s value in observing that.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… I wonder… I’ve never thought about it before so I don’t know.

…… What about you, Anzu-san? Do you like animals?

…… I see. I heard that there’s no bad people who like animals, so Anzu-san must not be a bad person.

(Location: Outside the Auditorium)

**Nagisa**: …… Hm? Who bumped into me just now?

…… Oh I see, it was Anzu-san. Ah, there’s no need to apologize.

…… It’s my fault for crouching down in a place like this.

> Option 1: Are you dirty anywhere?

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… I’m not dirty, but even if I were I’d be cleaned as soon as I returned to the academy so there’s no issue.

…… Although Ibara’s always busy doing this or that he still pays attention to these kinds of details.

…… Even though there’s no particular problem with being dirty, people seem very concerned about it.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… I didn’t fall down or bump into anything so I’m not dirty.

…… It’s not a big deal, but I can tell Anzu-san is worried about it.

…… I’m fine, so if you’re in a hurry it might be better to head where you need to go now.

> Option 2: Do you need help finding something?

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… No. I’m not looking for anything in particular so I don’t need any help.

…… Why was I crouching down? Ah, I found some cat footprints and had been staring at them since.

…… It doesn’t go anywhere and the footprints only appear here. Was the ground wet? It’s strange.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… Anzu-san is kind.

…… Tsumugi-kun is kind as well. Perhaps that’s just a trait of Yumenosaki students.

…… I’m happy to have experienced your kindness. Thank you, Anzu-san.

(Location: Secret Room)

**Nagisa**: …… Where is this place? I seem to have gotten lost again…

…… Anzu-san? Ah, I’m glad to see you’re here too.

…… Before I knew it I had gotten myself lost in a strange place. I’m in a bit of trouble.

> Option 1: Should I show you the way?

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… In that case, can you guide me to Ibara?

…… With me gone, I’m sure Ibara is searching for me.

…… I want to show my face to him and reassure him.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… Yes, please. If you can guide me to the garden terrace then I’ll be saved from this predicament.

…… Wait a moment. The phone in your pocket, it’s vibrating isn’t it? It’s probably an incoming call. Do you need to step aside?

……Thank you. Please guide me once you’re done.

> Option 2: This is the secret room.

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… Secret room? Ah, I see.

…… I remember hearing from Ibara that there’s a room that doesn’t officially exist. This must be that room.

…… I’m an outsider, so I shouldn’t stay here too long. Thank you for informing me, Anzu-san.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… Secret room? I’ve never heard of it before.

…… I don’t recall hearing anything about this when I attended the school.

…… Although if I had, I probably forgot it.
