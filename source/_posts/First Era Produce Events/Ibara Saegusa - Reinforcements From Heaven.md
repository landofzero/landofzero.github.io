(Location: Hallway)

**Ibara**: Your Excellency~? Where did you go, Your Excellency~? 

Oya? Anzu-san, meeting you here must be reinforcements from Heaven! The truth is, His Excellency has disappeared. 

I’m very sorry to trouble you, but I would truly be blessed if you would help me look for him! 

> Option 1: Where was the last place you saw him? 

(Response A)

**Ibara**: The last time I saw him was at the Garden Terrace! 

He was reading a book, and that view made for such a lovely picture~ 

It could be that he has moved on to find other books. Let us look for him in the library! 

(Response B)

**Ibara**: The garden terrace! 

However, it seems that Yumenosaki Academy’s cafeteria is structured to use meal tickets to purchase food with…… No no, I don’t mean to make fun of you! 

Because each of Shuuetsu Academy’s luxury restaurants has their own chefs who will propose the most optimum menu for our exclusive use, it simply feels novel! 

> Option 2: Of course. 

(Response A)

**Ibara**: Thank you very much! 

Anzu-san’s help is akin to the strength of a hundred people! Ah, I am truly lucky! 

I would be most grateful if you would contact me on my smartphone once you find His Excellency! I will come running no matter where it will be! 

(Response B)

**Ibara**: As expected of Anzu-san, you’re so kind! 

Even my filty self feels as though I’ve been purified when touched by that kindness! AHaHaHa♪ 

Oops, this isn’t the time to be chatting. Well then, I’ll be counting on you!

(Location: 1st Floor Passage)

**Ibara**: Anzu-san, thank you oh so much! Salute~☆ 

As I’m not one of the students of this Academy, if I were to search all over by myself, I surely would have gotten lost! 

I’m glad to have run into Anzu-san! I really am lucky! 

> Option 1: I got lost at first, too. 

(Response A)

**Ibara**: I see. So you have that easy to like aspect to you, Anzu-san! 

If you found interesting places or such when you got lost, please do tell me about it! 

Hmm, you’ve walked here every day so you’ve long since forgotten about it? AHaHaHa♪ That’s just a matter of course, isn’t it! 

(Response B)

**Ibara**: Come to think of it, you’re a transfer student! 

In that case, if Anzu-san had transferred to Shuuetsu Academy, maybe we could have been classmates?

Due to Shuuetsu Academy’s structure, that probably wouldn’t happen in real life. Being classmates with Anzu-san sounds so sweet♪ 

> Option 2: You’ve been investigating. 

(Response A)

**Ibara**: Ooh, so you know, Anzu-san! 

It’s true that I did some research, but as expected, there is a huge difference between looking at the information and actually walking around! 

I am grateful from the depths of my heart for all of your help, Anzu-san! 

(Response B)

**Ibara**: AHaHaHa, you got that one point from me…..☆ 

I’ve had a grasp on Yumenosaki Academy facilities, but I haven’t actually walked around!  

Moreover with it being this big, getting lost is a given!

(Location: Garden Space)

**Ibara**: Oops, Anzu-san! Today is the day I randomly meet you isn’t it? 

No no, if anything, I’m very happy to see Anzu-san so many times!

More importantly, what you’re holding onto dearly with both hands…… Aah, of course it’s fine to just say what you want to! 

> Option 1: ……Would you like to try it on? 

(Response A)

**Ibara**: ……What? Oops, sorry for the lifeless reply! 

However, to my eyes, it appears to be an Alice costume for use by women…… Ah, it really is Alice?

As you can see, the size is slightly too small for me. Oh my, I’m truly sorry! 

(Response B)

**Ibara**: Ooh, a light blue apron dress! Is this Alice’s costume? To my amazement, it’s handmade by Anzu-san……! 

If you don’t mind someone like me trying it on, I will happily try it on! Is there anywhere I can go change? 

Eh, a joke? Oh my, really! How rude of me! AHaHaHa♪ 

> Option 2: It’s Alice’s costume. 

(Response A)

**Ibara**: Alice’s costume…..? The costume used in Wondergame…… It doesn’t seem like it. 

Oops, sorry for prying! If it’s uncomfortable for you, I will zip my mouth shut so please don’t hesitate…… 

That’s not the case? Anzu-san made this costume because it’s your hobby? I’m impressed at how adept you are at sewing♪ 

(Response B)

**Ibara**: I see, so you made this costume as a hobby? Wow, what a coincidence! 

The truth is, this time’s Wonder Game is also based on Alice’s motifs! May I touch it for a bit?

Thank you very much! Ooh, such intiricate handiwork! Even as a layman, I can tell that this costume is wonderful!
