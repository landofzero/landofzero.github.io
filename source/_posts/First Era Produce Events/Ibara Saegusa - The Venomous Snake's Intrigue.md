(Location: Adam’s Private Room)

**Ibara**: If it isn’t Anzu-san! You’re as beautiful as ever today!

Your skin is absolutely glowing! That must mean you got a good night’s sleep last night!

It must be hard to even just move around, so I hope you aren’t too tired!

> Option 1: You’re always in high spirits aren’t you.

(Response A)

**Ibara**: Ahaha, I’ve been like this since I woke up in the morning! I’ve learned to live a regular lifestyle!

Is it like being in the military, you ask? Well, I’ve certainly been in an environment like that!

Saying “Salute~☆” is also a remnant of those days!

(Response B)

**Ibara**: Oops? Were you perhaps taken aback?

My deepest apologies! I can hardly stomach making such an important customer feel uncomfortable!

I will make sure this kind of misbehavior never happens again…… Please forgive me!

> Option 2: I went to a hot spring.

(Response A)

**Ibara**: Haha, I see! That beautiful skin is also due to the effects of the hot spring!

Relieve your fatigue and get beautiful skin! I didn’t know there was a secret hot spring nearby!

I can feel the blood of a businessman in my veins! Ahaha♪

(Response B)

**Ibara**: Hot spring? Ah, now that I think about it you had to change your accommodations last minute, didn’t you!

Yuzuru got involved, huh…… It’s a pity you didn’t get to stay at the hotel we arranged for you!

If you have a chance to come here again then please do stay with us!

(Location: Adam’s Private Room)

**Ibara**: By the way, Anzu-san, where are you going this morning?

I couldn’t find Isara-san, so I was wondering if perhaps he was with you?

Ah, I just asked out of curiosity! You don’t have to force yourself to answer♪

> Option 1: Then it’s a secret.

(Response A)

**Ibara**: Ahaha, Anzu-san is so secretive! Mysterious……☆

What’s that? If I tell you about myself then you’ll tell me your secret?

An unexpected exchange condition! You’re quite a “go-getter” Anzu-san! Ahaha♪

(Response B)

**Ibara**: Hm, I see…… Anzu-san and Isara-san have a secret relationship, and–

Oops, you dropped your tablet! Did I upset you?

That tablet costs quite a bit of money so be careful while handling it!

> Option 2: A-Actually……

(Response A)

**Ibara**: Eh, you two got lost?

If you had contacted me, then I would have rushed to you at the speed of light! Oh, what a shame!

You should know my contact information. Just in case, I’ll give you another business card! (He hands out his business card)

(Response B)

**Ibara**: Hmmm, actually……? There’s no continuation!

Maybe there’s something deep between the two of you that I can’t fully understand……!?

Ahaha! I’m very sorry, I’ll refrain from my pointless prying for now!

(Location: Adam’s Autumn Live Stage)

**Ibara**: Your Excellency~! Where are you, Your Excellency~?

Oh, if it isn’t Anzu-san! Finally, the real Autumn Live show is about to begin!

Let’s be fair today! Or rather, please be gentle! Ahaha☆

> Option 1: …… I look forward to working with you.

(Response A)

**Ibara**: Oh, you turned away!

Hmm~…… Did Yuzuru say something to you?

However, I believe in Anzu-san! I’m not the type to believe in gossip that has no basis in facts……☆

(Response B)

**Ibara**: Oh? What’s wrong, Anzu-san?

Could it be something to do with me……!? I’m sorry! I deeply apologize!

So please join me in creating a perfect live show!

> Option 2: What were you doing?

(Response A)

**Ibara**: Ah, have you seen His Excellency? He disappeared the moment I took my eyes off him!

Eh, he was looking at the ground over there?

Ahaha, it’s pretty much as I expected! Thank you very much, Anzu-san! Salute~☆

(Response B)

**Ibara**: Ah, that’s right! Actually, His Excellency has suddenly disappeared again!

I’m sure he’ll be back by the time the show starts!

There is a possibility that his precious costume with be covered in mud, so I must aim to collect him as soon as possible!
