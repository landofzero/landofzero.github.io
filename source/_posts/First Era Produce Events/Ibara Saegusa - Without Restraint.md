(Location: Garden Terrace)

**Ibara**: My, my, if it isn’t Anzu-san! I’m so terribly honored that someone such as yourself would call out to me! Salute~☆

Come to think of it, just a short while ago you had been in a room that’s off-limits to unauthorized personnel, weren’t you?

Ah, pardon me! I simply couldn’t get a good view of you then because of the partition blocking my view, so I was curious!

> Option 1: I was doing this and that.

(Response A)

**Ibara**: Is that so…… Ah, don’t mind me! If you should ever find yourself in trouble, this humble Ibara Saegusa is here to help!

Rather than standing around chatting, how about we talk over tea?

Of course, I will be the one to provide the tea, so worry not!

(Response B)

**Ibara**: Ah, please don’t worry! I’m not going to pry into other people’s affairs!

Oh, you don’t believe these eyes, do you?

AHaHa♪ As expected of an outstanding producer like Anzu-san, you’re quite cautious!

> Option 2: How about we eat?

(Response A)

**Ibara**: Aye aye♪ Of course!

Research is my forte, so I’ve already looked up appealing restaurants near Yumenosaki Academy in advance.

Japanese, Western, or Chinese food, which would you prefer? My preferences are trivial, so let’s go eat whatever Anzu-san wants to eat!

(Response B)

**Ibara**: Oh, you’re inviting a filthy human such as myself to a meal are you!

Anzu-san is an angel! The Virgin Mary! A lady akin to a goddess!

Hm? You’re frequently referred to as a goddess by everyone in Trickstar? As expected of Anzu-san, you’re simply adored……☆

(Location: Garden Terrace)

**Ibara**: Ah! My apologies for staring at a woman’s face so rudely!

No, no, it’s nothing of the sort.

Well. It’s been a while since I last met with you, but Anzu-san is still as beautiful as ever and I was simply captivated!

> Option 1: If I’m “beautiful”……

(Response A)

**Ibara**:  Those flowers are more beautiful, you say?

Hmm, do you like flowers, Anzu-san? That’s good to hear!

Next time, I’ll bring a bouquet of roses, so please look forward to it……☆

(Response B)

**Ibara**: Eh? His Excellency is more beautiful, you say?

How humble! It’s true that His Excellency possesses a beautiful face, but if you ask me I’d say you’re quite comparable to him!

Oh my, I feel so frustrated at my own incompetence for being unable to convince you of such……!

> Option 2: Please don’t praise me so much.

(Response A)

**Ibara**: No, no, anyone would sing your praises to the heavens if they came before your presence, Anzu-san!

Hmm, is that not the case for the Yumenosaki Academy students? Well, I find that hard to believe coming from my own experiences!

I can’t believe they don’t have the words to praise this beautiful face. I suppose they’re all just a bunch of simpletons, aHaHa♪

(Response B)

**Ibara**: Are you, perchance, embarrassed?

Even when your cheeks are flushed with embarrassment, you’re beautiful!

…… Oh, you’ve turned a bright red like a boiled octopus. Apologies! I’ll watch my wording from now on!

# Episode 3

(Location: Garden Terrace)

**Ibara**: Anzu-san, here’s some tea! As well as some sweets!

If there’s anything else you need, I’ll provide it!

Feel free to ask anything of this Ibara Saegusa! Salute~☆

> Option 1: I’ve also prepared something.

(Response A)

**Ibara**: Oh, as expected of the talented producer who’s Yumenosaki Academy’s pride and joy!

When it comes to hospitality, it seems I’m still no match for Anzu-san!

I will also continue to improve myself every day!

(Response B)

**Ibara**: Could this be Anzu’s homemade sweets? How magnificent! You’re even skilled at cooking!

…… Eh? Ah, yes! I would love to try it!

Nom nom…… Oh, this is superb♪ It’s the best sweet I’ve ever eaten!

> Option 2: I’m the host here.

(Response A)

**Ibara**: No, no! If you were to treat me well, I would be so moved that I wouldn’t be able to continue our meeting!

An exaggeration? I’ve done no such thing. So please, leave it to me!

I will pamper you to your heart’s content, Anzu-san~☆

(Response B)

**Ibara**: Oh my! My apologies, I was trying to be considerate, but it appears I ended up troubling you.

I’m the one who suddenly barged in, so please don’t worry!

We’re also having a meeting today, so please think of these sweets as a gift and partake in them!
