(Location: Garden Terrace)

**Nagisa**: …… Anzu-san, good afternoon.

…… Yes, I wondered if I should say hello since we’re acquaintances.

…… How are you faring, Anzu-san?

> Option 1: What about you?

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… Yes, I’m doing well.

…… It doesn’t look that way? Sorry, I’m not good at expressing myself properly.

…… Perhaps I should create a new character to act as? Maybe then I’d be able to express my emotions better than I do now.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… Everyone seems to be doing well. 

…… Jun especially seems to be doing well after the Rebirth Live.

…… It’s good to feel lively. It’ll make the people around you feel better and brighter.

> Option 2: Thanks to you, I’m doing well

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… It’s not good to lie, I think.

…… Anzu-san seems bothered by something, but then why are you acting like you’re fine?

…… I don’t understand it.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… I see. That’s good.

…… I’m sorry, Anzu-san. The conversation got interrupted.

…… I’m not very good at talking, so it’d be helpful if Anzu-san could take charge of it.

(Location: Garden Terrace)

**Nagisa**: ……? Anzu-san, did you say something?

…… Sorry, I was reading a book and didn’t hear a word you said.

…… Are you curious about the book? I can lend it to you when I’m finished with it.

> Option 1: Are you hungry?

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… Now that you say it, I am feeling hungry.

…… I had breakfast this morning, but I haven’t eaten lunch yet.

…… Isn’t it lunch time, Anzu-san? In that case, allow me to join you.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… I’m not very hungry, I think.  But, why did you ask me that?

…… Hmm, the food at the garden terrace is delicious so you wanted me to eat it as well.

…… Then I should have said I was hungry. I’m sorry, Anzu-san.

> Option 2: Oh, no, I can’t take that.

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… Why do you say “you can’t take that?”

…… Is it because you think I treasure this book? Do I cherish this book?

…… So that’s how it is, even if Anzu-san were to ask I wouldn’t know how to answer. I’m sorry to bother you.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… There’s no need to be shy. I remember everything I’ve read.

…… You see, this is an archaeology book. I like archaeology, so I’ve taken up collecting books and stones.

…… Are you not interested? If so then we can talk about something else.

# Episode 3

(Location: Garden Terrace)

**Nagisa**: …… Umm. I remember when ordering, I had to buy a meal ticket from the ticket machine first.

…… Excuse me, Anzu-san. I wonder, did the dining room menu change?

…… I feel like a lot of the items on the menu weren’t there when I was attending Yumenosaki Academy.

> Option 1: The menu changes frequently.

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… I see, there’s also a limited-time menu.

…… Hm? Right now, this kalbi yakiniku set meal is on the limited menu.

…… If Anzu-san recommends it then I’ll order it.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… I see. Menus that aren’t very popular will get replaced.

…… If you lose the struggle for existence, you can’t help but disappear, right?

…… Not just in the idol industry, but everywhere, there’s constant conflict.

> Option 2: There’s a limited menu for each day of the week.

(Response A)

**Nagisa**: …… Hmm, there’s even something like that here.

…… But wouldn’t it be troublesome to have to change the menu every day of the week?

…… I’m not that picky about food, so it makes me wonder.

(Response B)

**Nagisa**: …… Hmmm. The weekday menus seem to be limited in quantity.

…… However, that’s why everyone is so desperate to buy from it.

…… I’m not interested in that kind of thing, but I think it’s wonderful that humanity can experience desperation like that.
