(Location: Shuuetsu Hallway)

**Ibara**: It’s been a while, Anzu-san! I’m extremely delighted to have been given the honor to meet you again! Salute~☆

Ahaha♪ Indeed! It truly hasn’t been that long since we last corresponded!

Thanks to your gracious assistance, this humble Autumn Live will be held successfully!

> Option 1: Please talk normally.

(Response A)

**Ibara**: Does this way of speaking bother you? It’s true, people have told me it’s not fitting for an idol!

However, it’s not that easy to adjust…… Of course, I’ll do my best to fix it!

I’m still inexperienced, so I’ll continue to work hard every day! Assault! Invade! Conquer~!

(Response B)

**Ibara**: Oh, does it make you uncomfortable? I’m deeply sorry for causing such discomfort! I truly apologize!

…… Or rather, you don’t want me to be too concerned about it?

To be kind to even filthy trash such as myself… As expected of a wonderful person like Anzu-san!

> Option 2: Y-You’re exaggerating……

(Response A)

**Ibara**: What’s that? Why, your troubled face is also quite beautiful! Your beauty is so immense that I can hardly look at you!

Even the distorted eyebrows are adorable! That shape, that angle! It’s a beauty that can only be called a miracle!

It’s such a perfect golden ratio, even the goddess of beauty runs away barefooted!(1)

(Response B)

**Ibara**: I’m humbled by your modesty! Rather, I think it’s wonderful! Your lack of conceit is dazzling……!

As expected of Yumenosaki Academy’s only producer! An irreplaceable miracle! A light of hope!

Although it’s only been a short one week period, I’m truly honored to have met you! Thank you for your cooperation!

# Episode 2

(Location: Shuuetsu Hallway)

**Ibara**: It seems we have some time until Trickstar finishes getting dressed?

You probably have nothing to do while waiting so allow me to tell you more about Shuuetsu Academy!

If you have any questions, please take advantage of this opportunity! Please feel free to ask me anything……☆

> Option 1: Ask about school life.

(Response A)

**Ibara**: Do you want to hear about lessons in particular? Well, this is something that’s only natural for students from another school to be curious about, isn’t it!

However, this is a school secret! If I let anything leak then it’d be off with my head!

It’s a cheap offer but if you’re truly interested in learning more then I recommend that you join the agency.

(Response B)

**Ibara**: Oh, you especially want to know about the food situation!

Well, Anzu-san  has a great eye for these things! I was thinking of showing you around later!

Shuuetsu Academy cafeteria…… You will definitely enjoy the taste of our original Japanese restaurant!!

> Option 2: Ask about Eden.

(Response A)

**Ibara**: Hm? Haven’t you read this yet, Anzu-san? (He holds out a booklet)

This is a booklet with an overview of Eden…… Hm? You have read it?

Oh, I see you have the guidebook too! How delightful! Thank you very much!

(Response B)

**Ibara**: My, my, Anzu-san! You’re surprisingly shrewd!

I said I would explain about Shuuetsu Academy, but now you’re trying to extract useful information!

Ah, no, no! There’s no need to apologize! I did say “anything,” ahaha☆

# Episode 3

(Location: Shuuetsu Hallway)

**Ibara**: It seems everyone in Trickstar are kind people! I feel relieved!

I heard stories about it from Anzu-san and decided to do some research into it myself.

After all, my impression of them will change once I actually meet them! I’m looking forward to performing with them live even more♪

> Option 1: I look forward to working with you.

(Response A)

**Ibara**: Hm? You would like to say hello to the members of Adam as well?

In short, you would like to meet His Excellency…… That is, Ran Nagisa-san, as soon as possible!

I’m sorry but I’ll have to keep you waiting! His Excellency is a free spirit and it’s often quite difficult to keep a handle on him!

(Response B)

**Ibara**: Hmm? Why are you suddenly panicking? …… Did you forget you brought your souvenir with you?

Ah, pardon my concern! Rather, I’m glad! Thank you very much!

Is it a local specialty? As expected of Anzu-san, you have a great sense of souvenir selection!

> Option 2: What was your impression?

(Response A)

**Ibara**: After listening to Anzu-san’s stories, I can say that the members are on good terms with each other.

When I actually met them, I was surprised to see they got along with each other very well!

It was refreshing to hear them calling each other nicknames like “Hokke~” and “Sally~”! Ah, how beautiful it is to have friends……☆

(Response B)

**Ibara**: Ah, it’s not like I had a bad impression of them!

Not to mention Akehoshi Subaru-san and Hidaka Hokuto-san, but Yuuki Makoto-san had made quite the name for himself as a child model.

If you look into it a little, you can quickly come to the conclusion that you’ve got a great group! Ahaha♪
