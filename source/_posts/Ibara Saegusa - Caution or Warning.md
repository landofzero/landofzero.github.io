(Location: Cafe)

**Ibara**: Ahaha! I never expected Anzu-san to accept my invitation so readily. I’m very happy to hear that!

…… And that’s enough flattery. To my understanding, you accepted the invitation because you felt guilty, right?

The people who decided to accept the 2x2 job were the two from 2wink. You were just respecting their wishes.

> Option 1: But……

**Ibara**: There’s no “but” about it. Arrangements have already begun, and you must have been making preparations for some time.

Is this a time to brood? For now, take responsibility for the new program and the idols appearing on it, and focus on seeing it through to the end.

> Option 2: I apologize for the inconvenience……

**Ibara**: I don’t know what will happen in the future, but…… So far, I haven’t had any trouble.

It’s true that no matter how active 2wink is on that program, there’s nothing in it for us, so I can’t exactly be thankful for it!

> Option 3: Thank you……

**Ibara**: Instead of saying “thank you,” your face looks like it’s saying “I’m sorry.”

This time, I’m not involved in the program at all. If you would like to show your gratitude, then please give generously to our office’s idols.

**Ibara**: …… Or rather, the huge amount of material you were compiling the other day was for 2x2.

I got the point from both your unclear answer and your unsatisfied attitude.

Factional conflicts are common. Wouldn’t it be better to learn more about tactics and strategies to not only survive, but to also advance yourself?

> Option 1: Hm\~mm……

**Ibara**: I don’t think there’s anything wrong with increasing the number of weapons you can use on the battlefield.

If you think that it’ll be a burden to you or a negative, I won’t force you to do it. It’s just a suggestion.

> Option 2: Is there a way to prevent it?

**Ibara**: Hold on, how could you have prevented this situation?

…… If you’re thinking about self-defense in the future, I think you should take this opportunity to learn. For you, and for the idols.

> Option 3: You mean the secret of success in life?

**Ibara**: Ah, I think you’re missing that too. The world is not so kind that you can get by with only good humanity.

Kindness can sometimes hurt the dignity of others. Therefore, I think it’s a necessary skill to “not hurt others.”

# Episode 3

(Location: Cafe)

**Ibara**: —Now then. If we keep talking like this, you’ll get bored and won’t be able to relax.

You may be dissatisfied with the long wait when your menu has only been opened. Shall we choose something and order it?

A seasonal limited menu, a meal set only available during lunch…… Has Anzu-san already decided what she wants to eat?

> Option 1: Have you decided yet?

**Ibara**: Yes. Since I only order drinks, I just have to look at the pages that have drinks and decide quickly.

Even if you tell me to eat properly…… I understand. I’ll eat something, so please don’t be so aggressive at times like this.

> Option 2: I’m still worried.

**Ibara**: If I could give Anzu-san one piece of advice, it would be to use the calorie index as a reference at restaurants.

See, it’s listed next to each menu item. Looking beyond photos and prices may help solve your problem.

> Option 3: I want to think about it a little more.

**Ibara**: You’re having trouble deciding which of the three limited menu items to choose…… Then, let’s make a quick decision using Ghost Leg lottery.(1)

And if you want to try other things, just visit again during the offer period. If you do that, you’ll eventually conquer the menu♪

TL NOTES:
<ol>
<li>Ghost Leg is a method of lottery where vertical lines are drawn between the players and an outcome, with horizontal legs between those lines (as added by the players, who don’t know which end of the vertical lines equals what/who). From there, the players trace down from the top of the vertical line, crossing between lines whenever a horizontal leg is encountered until they reach the bottom and receive whatever outcome that indicates. In Japan, it’s referred to as “阿弥陀籤” (Amidakuji). It’s also known as “사다리타기” (Sadaritagi) in Korea and “鬼腳圖” (Guijiaotu) in China.</li>
