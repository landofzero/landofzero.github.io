**Mere**: Hello, Ra~s. What are you drawing today?

**Vanis**: ……… (He moves away)

**Mere**: (He moves closer) The weather is nice today, it makes for a good day to draw.

**Vanis**: ……… (He moves away. Mere moves closer again) 

You should at least understand that I’m ignoring you. When you’re around, I lose the motivation to draw.

**Mere**: It’s alright, Mere won’t interfere. It’s enough for you to just talk whenever you feel like talking. Like this.

**Vanis**: Seriously, you really are—! You don’t intend to understand my feelings!

**Mere**: Fufu. I’m by your side now because I want to understand, Ra~s.

**Vanis**: (internally) …… No matter what I say to this guy, it’s no use……

(Internally) Anyway, I’ll just think to myself, ‘This guy isn’t here’…… And immerse myself in my painting……

**Mere**: Fufu.

(Internally) I can’t believe he let me be by his side like this. Ra~s is also gradually opening up to me.
