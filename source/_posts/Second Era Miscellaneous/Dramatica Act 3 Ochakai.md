**March Hare (spoken)**: Welcome to the tea party!

[Verse]

**March Hare**: I see you’ve arrived with empty hands.

But that’s alright, isn’t it?

**Mad Hatter**: Even though you’re not prepared, even though you’re not ready

It doesn’t matter even if you aren’t prepared

(**March Hare**: Come on, wake up and sing with us!)

**Dormouse**: Even if you’re awake, or if you’re asleep

It doesn’t really make any difference, you know

**March Hare**: Then let’s get started

(**Mad Hatter**: Let’s do it)

**All**: An eccentric tea party

[Pre-Chorus]

**March Hare**: If you’re feeling like you’re falling,

**Mad Hatter**: Just think of it as flying

**March Hare + Mad Hatter**: It mostly depends on how you’re feeling then

**Dormouse**: Ah, I want to sleep.

**March Hare + Mad Hatter**: Think of it as a dream

(**Dormouse**: (Mumbling) … Is this a dream?)

[Chorus]

**All**: Then, let’s sing! Let’s dance!

And gulp down all the tea we can drink

What we think of as fun,

**Mad Hatter**: Such as pouring tea.

Shall I fill up my hat?

**Dormouse**: With full stomachs

**March Hare**: And full hearts

**Mad Hatter (then all)**: Everyone’s happy at the Mad Tea Party

**March Hare**: Waking up happy

**Dormouse**: And sleeping happily

**Mad Hatter (then all)**: Let’s make merry together

[Verse]

**Dormouse**: Even if I want to yawn or belch, why are they not showing up?

**March Hare**: Because the tea is swirling in you

(**Mad Hatter**: Preferably)

**All**: Let’s fall into madness

[Pre-Chorus]

**All**: Pushed to the limit of both overflowing excitement

**Dormouse**: And oddly quiet sleep

**All**: Tea will make it happen

**March Hare then Mad Hatter**: It’s all according to your wishes

[Chorus]

**All**: Then it’s a happy party time

**All then March Hare**: That’s why we’ll reject anything else

**All**: It’s colorful and wonderful

**Mad Hatter**: So many colors to choose from

So let’s be greedy

**Dormouse**: It’s like a dream

**March Hare**: It’s not a dream

**Dormouse**: (Mumbling) I see, then good night

**Mad Hatter**: I don’t mind it.

**March Hare**: That’s fine.

**All**: Do whatever you like

**Dormouse**: Because it’s in a dream

**Mad Hatter**: Let’s lose our hearts in it

**March Hare**: That’s what a tea party is for

**Mad Hatter**: Are you also fulfilled?
