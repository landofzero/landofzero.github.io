Reaching my hand towards the brilliantly aggregating *Stardust*,

Our mellow interests-

No,

Shall we call this scene of heat-filled entangled gazes; love?

Those who desire mutually attract beings who desire,

If you were to just barely surrender on the very first encounter, then…

Show me your dreams through those dreaming eyes; casting light upon your unleashed desires,

You may lay yourself bare while you feel and trust as you please;

Locking eyes with each other in the depths of the cheering audience that would even steal reason away,

In the eyes of an accomplice is a *Salute*

If you don’t mind being held captive by *Addiction*,

to be pure is to choose  without inhibition,

By all means, isn’t endlessly pitting yourself against others what will polish you?

When dancing with you who seeks to have an encounter upon the stage,

The hand of time that had allowed time to begin will never come to a halt again

With those responsive eyes, point out the path towards a more dazzling world,

When you’re wanting, when you’re getting deeper; Our beats overlap

When you realise it, you will no longer be able to break free,

In the depths of the cheering audience, we will join hands

I will offer you a smile

*Salute*

Show me your dreams through those dreaming eyes; casting light upon your unleashed desires,

You may lay yourself bare while you feel and trust as you please;

Yes,

With those responsive eyes, point out the path towards a more dazzling world,

When you’re wanting, when you’re getting deeper; Our beats overlap

Locking eyes with each other in the depths of the cheering audience that would even steal reason away,

The testament of complicity

is displayed in your eyes,

In the everlasting desire is a *Salute*
