# MC 1

**Hiyori**: “Thank you for coming to our, Eden’s, independent live today! It sure is a blessing to be able to celebrate the album release together!

We’ve loaded our love into the songs to be delivered to you. Receive them without leaving out a single one, okay……♪”

**Jun**: “The first song we performed was KEEP OUT.

How was this song that was specifically written for the album?”

**Nagisa**: “…… I’m glad that you seem to like it. KEEP OUT means ‘no trespassing’.

…… We’re going to break into everyone’s hearts. Into the shining paradise, like a lurking viper.”

**Ibara**: “And then we will slowly and carefully pour poison into you, and show you sweet dreams.

So that tonight’s stage may become an unforgettable memory……♪”

**Jun**: “Afterwards, we’ll perform two songs; one after the other~ That first song is—”

**Nagisa and Ibara**: “…… Melting Rouge Soul.”

# MC 2

**Ibara**: “Melting Rouge Soul from Adam, and Ruby Love from Eve have been performed.

Both of these were songs unveiled at Chocolat Fes— during Valentine’s season.

**Nagisa**: “…… Yeah. At that time, the fact that both Adam and Eve were releasing new songs at the same time became a hot topic.

…… The cheering during the moment Ibara and I said “Melting Rouge Soul” felt really good.”

**Ibara**: “Fufu. I’m sure there are a lot of people who did not expect it because it’s called Eden’s independent live.

I told you, didn’t I? That I’ll show you sweet dreams……♪”

**Hiyori**: “Adam’s fans, Eve’s fans, as well as Eden’s fans—

Today we will satisfy every single person who loves us.

You’re prohibited from looking away! Keep your eyes on us till the very end♪

Jun-kun, you can’t blink either!”

**Jun**: “Eeh, please let me blink~ My eyes will get dry.

Oh, seems like they got everything ready while we were talking. The next song will be a solo song.

Ibara Saegusa’s— Salute Desire.”

# MC 3

**Ibara**: “— That was Salute Desire

Oops. Thank you for the warm applause.

Though I endeavored to give a more perfect performance than usual—

During a solo song, everyone’s gazes are concentrated on me from every possible angle, so my mind could not even be inattentive for even a single moment.

Above all else, I’m glad that you were satisfied♪

Now, let me briefly introduce myself.

I am Eden’s Ibara Saegusa. Salute~☆

As you see, alongside my idol activities, I’m also serving concurrently as the producer of Eden and the vice president of the agency.

I’m very happy to be able to deliver the new song as well as the accompanying event to everyone.

I will continue to work energetically, so I ask you to please continue to treat Eden and Cosmic Production well☆

The next song will be brought to you by the four members of Eden.

Let us show you our way of life— Paradise Banishment -Faith Conquest-”

# MC 4

**Nagisa**: “…… We’ve performed Paradise Banishement -Faith Conquest-.

…… It was first unveiled during Conquest wasn’t it. It’s a song containing Eden’s faith.

…… Hiyori-kun doesn’t really like it, I wonder?”

**Hiyori**: “No. I like the song itself. It’s a song that’s just like Eden.

But I’ve had enough of Conquest! Even if it’s a farce, I don’t want to act like we’re fighting and hating each other.

We’re aaaalways been the best united, mutually loving, unit—

I’m sure the fans don’t want to see us like that too.”

**Nagisa**: “…… I agree. The loud cheers that could shake the whole venue is the greatest proof of that.

…… Let’s keep getting along, Hiyori-kun.

…… As an ‘equal friend.’”

**Hiyori**: “Yes. ‘Equal’……♪

Now now, next would be something everyone has been waiting for, my solo song!

Accept My Love— accept my love……!”(1)

**Hiyori**: “Thank you for listening to Accept My Love!

Yes yes. You’re smiling so much, I’m happy too☆

I’ll follow Ibara’s example and introduce myself. I am Eden’s Hiyori Tomoe!

Life isn’t all about fun. There’s times where you feel depressed and like you want to cry.

When that happens, it’s good to look at me. Because I’m the one who shines bright like the sun☆

Listen to my songs, and follow the productions I appear in—

Just imitate me and smile! Since I always have a smile on my face!

If you smile, the people around you will also smile. It’s a happiness chain reaction. What fine weather……☆

Now! Let’s move on to the next song, shall we?

All four of us will perform it, so please give us all of your support.

Eden’s— EXCEED.”

# MC 6

**Jun**: “I’ve just performed EXCEED. This song is—”

**Ibara**: “Isn’t this a song with a shady history for you, Jun?”

**Jun**: “Wait a sec. Could you please stop saying misleading things~?

It’s not like it’s got a shady history or anything, umm……

When we released this song, I had lost my confidence and kept makin’ mistakes.

But then, Ibara went out of character and comforted me by saying,’Why do you lose confidence when there are people who view you so favorably?’……”

**Ibara**: “‘Out of character’ is superfluous.”

**Jun**: “Haha. I won’t be able to be the same as Ohiisan, Nagi-senpai, or Ibara, but to that extent—

No. That’s why, as Jun Sazanami, I’ll continue to put in the effort as myself.

Eden is where I belong, y’know\~

Haha, thank you for all the applause. Sorry if I sounded like I was urging y’all to do something.”

**Ibara**: (Whispering) …… Honestly, Jun really was an idiot during that time.

There are so many people who love you.

**Jun**: “Hm? I couldn’t hear it over the applause, but you said something, right?”

**Ibara**: “No, it’s nothing. Please continue talking about yourself after you finish singing.

Now then, please listen. Jun Sazanami’s— Unlock the Soul.”

# MC 7

**Jun**: “Hello, everyone. It’s Eden’s Jun Sazanami.

How was Unlock the Soul?

The lyrics were good, weren’t they~. When I sing them, I get excited.

Speaking of lyrics, apparently Ibara wrote the lyrics to the song I just sang, EXCEED, for me.

Wha\~t? People might think I sound conceited when I say that.

But Nagi-senpai said it was to help me get over my slump or something. There’s no doubting it~

Well. That Ibara, he can be really kind sometimes\~♪

Haha. Ibara’s looking at me from the side of the stage with a face like he just swallowed a bitter bug.

I shouldn’t get carried away, or I’ll probably get scolded later\~

Now that I’ve told a story just for this special occasion, let’s get to the next song.

Eden’s— Absolute Perfection.”

# MC 8

**Nagisa**: “…… Absolute Perfection. This is the first song we performed at Absolute.

…… I am God♪

…… Ibara, please look. Everyone’s rejoicing.”

**Ibara**: “It seems so. Unlike Absolute’s stage, this is a country where countless gods rule.”

**Nagisa**: “…… That’s not the only reason.

…… There are many people here who love us. They weren’t present at Absolute either.”

**Ibara**: “Indeed. The presence of fans is an idol’s strength—their powerful weapon.

However. It’s not normal for Eden to be completely dependent on our fans.

Let’s be ourselves and make a triumphant return to Absolute with our utmost strength.

Then, we will receive our laurels and make ourselves known. Eden are the best idols in the world.”

**Nagisa**: “…… Yes. I’m sure our fans want that as well.

…… Because we’re the strongest idols, Eden.

…… Next, I’ll perform my solo song.”

**Ibara**: “Everyone please listen. Nagisa Ran’s—We’re all alone.”

# MC 9

<img src="/images/SecondEra/albumtalk/ej13cbfd.png">

**Nagisa**: “…… You just listened to We’re all alone.

…… I’m Eden’s Nagisa Ran. Thank you for coming to our live today.

…… Each song has its own memories. I was remembering all that happened while singing.

…… I wonder if you all have had the same experience? Since music and memories are connected to one another and committed to memory.

…… I wonder if everyone has some kind of emotional attachment to Eden’s songs.

…… If possible, I would like to ask each and every one of you individually. But, it would be difficult to do that today.

…… It would make me happy if you could let me know through a letter or handshake event.

…… I hope our songs may touch everyone’s hearts.

…… ‘The eternal paradise that touches the heart’— that’s what Eden is.

…… And now, it’s almost time for the end.

…… We’ll perform two songs in a row at the end. Eden’s— Awakening Myth.”

# MC 10

<img src="/images/SecondEra/albumtalk/l53mtdhk.png">

**Nagisa**: “……  It’s a shame, but let’s close the door to paradise.”

**Jun**: “It was nice to meet you. Thank you for coming to Eden’s independent live today!

Did you all have fun at our live?”

**Hiyori**: “You got to see my finest performance, so it must have been fun!

I swear on Ibara’s glasses that it’s true☆”

**Ibara**: “Could you please not involve me? If you’re going to swear on something, swear on Jun’s life instead.”

**Hiyori**: “That’s no good! Jun-kun’s life is mine!”

**Jun**: “My life is my own. Could you not swear on it so casually\~?”

**Nagisa**: “…… Hey, can I close the door to paradise?”

**Jun**: “C’moon, Nagi-senpai is bothered now, isn’t he?”

**Hiyori**: “Don’t make it sound like it’s my fault! It’s collective responsibility!”

**Jun**: “Alright alright. Now then, let’s meet again some time soon.”

# MC 11

<img src="/images/SecondEra/albumtalk/h9k1oxqb.png">

**Ibara**: “Everyone! Thank you for the magnificent encore!”

**Nagisa**: “…… The door to paradise opened right away.”

**Hiyori**: “No. It didn’t open on its own, we had to open it. With the power of everyone’s love♪

That’s why we also have to respond with love. Let’s share the love with everyone here.”

**Jun**: “The last song is, of course, this song!— BRAND NEW STARS!!!”

# MC 12

<img src="/images/SecondEra/albumtalk/x4f8x07o.png">

**Jun**: “That was BRAND NEW STARS!!! This is truly the end.

We did our best, though. When I think about how it’s over, I feel lonely after all, huh~”

**Hiyori**: “Everyone, thank you for singing with us! Thank you for your magnificent smiles!

Please come and see me again! I’ll be waiting♪”

**Nagisa**: “…… The door to paradise shall close again.

…… But I’m sure we’ll meet again. Without stopping, we’ll continue to grow.”

**Ibara**: “The latest information about Eden is always posted on the official SNS. Please take make use of it☆

Thank you for coming today! We’ll see you soon, salute~♪”
