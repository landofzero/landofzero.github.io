*We’re all alone……*

If I were to believe that knowing nothing is purity,

Should I simply conceal the billowing waves of my heart?

(*Where you are*)

Rather than living in a unchanging place where the wind can’t even be felt,

O, suffering…happiness too… even sin…

I will accept your existence

*We’re all alone*

That is why I set forth

If I can feel the wind;

My words should also reach you

Even if we’re unable to understand each other as people,

Do not fear it,

Let’s begin by discovering this world

I’ll go pick up and gather the grains of sands of truth

Till the still-unfulfilled heart forms its visage

(*What you want*)

Even if it might deemed a sin,

Like waves, I will do that deed over and over in search of love

Choosing my own conduct by myself…. I’ll step forth alongside your existence

*We’re all alone*

That’s precisely why I want to be connected

If it’s now, I should be able to grasp the meaning of the song riding on the wind

Acquiring everything is the same as losing just about everything

Alas, light materializes so that it may shine people out of the darkness

Isn’t that right?

*We’re all alone*

That is why I set forth

If my song can reach you

My feelings should be conveyed to you

If the miracle of receiving a glance from someone out there continues,

This world too will continue to expand beautifully…. Endlessly
