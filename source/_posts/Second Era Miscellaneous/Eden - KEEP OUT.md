**Nagisa**: Dance like a flame for the past we’ll never return to again

**Hiyori**: We won’t become the same shadows again

And that’s why we’re beautiful

**Jun**: *but don’t stop*, on the brink of the expected *black out* is only a fall

**Hiyori**: We’re the unstoppable two-of-a-kind

**Ibara**: *but don’t stop*, the barbed wire excluding the inexperienced;

**Nagisa**: We’ll show you how to pass through

**All**: Hurry up, cheat, and deceive the fresh groove

We want to take you away to paradise

Hurry up and get deeper

like a fall in dark

Right now what I need, is you

**Jun**: Hey, sin and punishment come and go

They might even become a curse for yourself

**Nagisa & Hiyori**: Oh oh oh oh

**Ibara**: A toast to the sour and sweet, *sweetie*

Hope for the light even if you prefer the darkness

**Nagisa & Hiyori**: *forget it, forget it*

You should be honest

**Adam**: *babe*,

**Ibara**: *I told you*, (**Nagisa**: *ah*) your goal is becoming distant

**Eve**: (*oh, oh oh oh*)

**Nagisa**: That’s why you’re coveting

**Adam**: *Oh oh oh oh*

**Eve**: *babe*,

**Hiyori**: *Did you get it*, burn till you’re cold

**Jun**: Don’t go against the signal of the tumultuous wave;

**Nagisa & Hiyori**: Our genes are calling for us

**All**: Come, cheat, and deceive the fresh groove

We want to take you away to paradise

Hurry up and get deeper

*like a fall in dark*

Right now what I need, is you

**All**: While you’re at it, work yourself up

Even if you’ll experience hardship,

We’re unable to stop until we reach paradise

The forbidden fruit ripens redder and redder

Right now what you need, is me

Right now what we need, is you

**All**: *hey my babe, I told you,*

*told you, you do you*

**Jun**: We’re here by the whims of Adam and Eve

**All**: *hey my babe, I told you,*

*told you, what do you*

**Ibara**: That every rendezvous has meaning

**All**: *hey my babe, I told you*

*told you, you do you*

**Hiyori**: The tears drunk from the overflowing glass are your oil

**All**: *hey my babe, I told you*

*told you, what do you*

**Nagisa**: If I can pass through

*KEEP OUT*
