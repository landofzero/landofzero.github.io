**Nagisa**: ……Eh. It should be about time to meet, but it seems like not everyone is here yet.

**Shu**: Hm, I wasn’t ever expecting that savage to be on time. Even so, it’s rare for Hinata-kun to not be arriving on time.

**Hinata**: Hah, haah……! I’m sorry for being late!

**Rinne**: Chee\~\~se ♪ Rinne-kun’s homemade Russian takoyaki has arrived!

**Nagisa**: …… Takoyaki? Are they freshly made? They look delicious.

**Shu**: By some chance, are you late because you were making these?

**Hinata**: Ahaha…… I was thinking of setting up a stall for the Fireworks Festival and ended up getting too excited.

How about trying one, my seniors? They’re hot and delicious\~♪

**Nagisa**: …… You gave this to me right as my stomach was starting to feel empty. Won’t you eat too, Shu-kun? 

**Shu**: Honestly, you can’t be helped…… However, it’ll be bad to waste valuable ingredients. I’ll cooperate with consuming it.

**Rinne**: By\~ the way, what’s the meetin’ for todaay? Won’t it be much better to put this boring meeting aside, puuut it aside, and just enjoy the party for the eve of the festival?

**Nagisa**: The truth is, Ibara entrusted me with this drone. We were talking about using it in the Fireworks Festival. So I’m asking for advice on what to do with it. 

**Shu**: Ah…… I feel like Kagehira had shown me a video of cargo being carried by drones some time ago. Though I think that’s quite difficult to apply to a fireworks display?

**Rinne**: Oy oy, if we’re talking about drones, it’s gotta be all about flashy aerial photography! I saw a video a while back that made it look like you’re inside the fireworks.

**Hinata**: In that case, it might be interesting to match the visuals with commentary!

**Nagisa**: …… I’ll ask Ibara if we could make that happen. Fufu, I’m excited to see what sort of visuals we could get.
