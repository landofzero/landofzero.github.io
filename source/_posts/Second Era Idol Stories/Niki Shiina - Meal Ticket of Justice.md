**Writer**: Yuumasu

**Season**: Winter

<!-- more -->

(Location: CosPro Office)

**Niki**: ‘Su~p, Staff-san. It’s Shiina Niki from Crazy:B.

Is the deputy director here? He asked me to come see him.

Hmm, he’s in the middle of a meeting with a client? It looks like it’ll be over in ten-ish minutes?

In that case, can I wait here? I’ll be in the corner so I won’t get in the way.

It’s a~lright. He asked me to come when I have time, and I don’t have any plans today.

By the way, you wouldn’t have heard from the deputy director about what kind of business he was looking at, wouldya?

Is that so~. …… Nah, nah, I’ll just ask him directly☆

Nahaha, thanks for your concern. Please keep up the good work, Staff-san~☆

(What the heck’s goin’ on if even the staff don’t know about it either~……?

I’m not happy about being the only one called here, it’s hard to comprehend.

Seriously, I have no idea~. …… Did someone from Crazy:B do something wrong?

But if it’s that then the leader would be called……

As if. I feel like calling in Rinne-kun wouldn’t do anything.

Does that mean I’m acting as a substitute for the leader? Even if that were the case, I think HiMERU-kun and Kohaku-chan are more suitable than me.

Hm\~m. If possible, it’d be great if he’d avoid talking about difficult topics\~……)

**Ibara**: —Thank you for waiting, Shiina-shi.

**Niki**: Deputy director! Thanks for your hard work at the meeting.

**Ibara**: I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me cut right to the chase.

Please take this.

**Niki**: A flyer for a newly opened restaurant—I don’t think it’s something like that. Uuummmm……

“Dance Workshop”?

**Ibara**: Yes, this is a workshop for ES idols.

Shiina-shi, your choreography sometimes appears sloppy compared to the other members of Crazy:B.

It’s free, so please consider this a prime opportunity and take part in it!

**Niki**: Uwaai. I-I’ll do my best……

**Ibara**: Contrary to your words, you look blatantly disgusted.

**Niki**: Hmm. To be honest, I’m not into the idea.

A dance workshop, huh… Just thinking about it makes me hungry.

**Ibara**: Haah…… Well, I expected you to say that.

Not to worry. I’ve prepared a proper reward for you.

**Niki**: Reward……?

**Ibara**: Indeed. If you participate in the workshop, you’ll be provided with this “meal ticket that can be used at restaurants nationwide.”

**Niki**: A m-meal ticket……! I want it, gimme!

**Ibara**: Ah ah, I won’t give it to you for free♪

Shiina-shi, you promise to attend the workshop, right?

**Niki**: I promise! I promise on my meal ticket, I’ll do my best……☆

(Location: Dance Room)

(A few days later. The day of the workshop.)

**Niki**: Meal ticket~♪ Free food~♪ Funfufufu~n……♪

**Chiaki**: Hm? Shiina will also be participating?

**Niki**: Oh, that’s Morisawa-ku~n, isn’t it!

I didn’t think I knew anyone here, so I’m relieved.

**Chiaki**: Me too. I always thought these workshops were mainly attended by new idols.

**Niki**: Same here. I was a little worried that I’d attract attention.

But if Morisawa-kun is here then it’s like a weight off my shoulders! It’s reassuring to be with you!

**Chiaki**: Right! Let’s encourage each other and work hard together……☆

**Niki**: Alright! …… Ah, it looks like the dance teacher’s here now.

Now’s the time~. I’ll do my best!

(Two hours later. After the workshop, self-study time)

**Niki**: That’s ho~rrible, Morisawa-kun!

I thought you were about on par with me, but you’re not that bad at all!

**Chiaki**: Sorry. It’s clear you’re also taking part in order to improve your skills……

**Niki**: Now that I think about it, in √AtoZ you learned the dance early on and taught it to everyone, right?

I wouldn’t have misunderstood if I remembered properly, but I forgot about it ‘til just now.

Uuu. It’s my own fault, but I feel like I’ve been left behind by the person I’d said “Let’s reach the goal together” to at a marathon race……

**Chiaki**: Shiina……

I’m really sorry. As an apology, could I join you in your self-study?

**Niki**: Eh? No, it’s my bad for not checking.

**Chiaki**: No. That won’t give me peace of mind.

In the process of teaching you, I’ll be able to learn about myself. Please let me help you!

(One hour later)

**Niki**: 1, 2, 3~♪ …… Turn here☆

Didya see that, Morisawa-kun? I did it exactly as you taught me!

**Chiaki**: Great, Shiina. You’re definitely making progress!

**Niki**: Nahaha. It’s thanks to you. Thanks for being patient with me……☆

I mean. Sorry for asking you to stick here with me ‘til the last minute before we have to leave even though you’re not getting anything in return.

**Chiaki**: Don’t sweat it. A hero is someone who helps someone without hesitation if they’re in trouble. Deserting you is against my sense of justice.

Besides, I did get something in return. I was able to support your growth. This sense of accomplishment is a joy beyond compare……☆

**Niki**: Justice, huh~…… Well then, I’ll also follow my own justice.

**Chiaki**: Shiina’s justice?

**Niki**: Fufufu. I have a meal ticket right here! To thank you for your guidance, I’ll treat you to dinner♪

Eating after a lotta dancing is so much fun! Life is fun. This is my justice……☆

**Chiaki**: I see. That’s your way of thinking.

Alright,  tonight let’s celebrate your growth and enjoy a meal!

**Niki**: Nahaha, I’m drooling just thinking about what to eat♪

C’mon c’mon, let’s go before we get too hungry……☆
