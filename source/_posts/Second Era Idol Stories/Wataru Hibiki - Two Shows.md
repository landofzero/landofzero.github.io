**Writer**: Suika

**Season**: Summer

<!-- more -->

**Nagisa**: …… It looks like I’ve arrived on site earlier than expected. 

…… It seems the job Hiyori-kun and Jun were at before this got prolonged, and Ibara is probably still in the middle of a meeting.

…… It might be okay to go to the filming location early…… Hm?

…… To think that there would be a crowd in front of a train station like this. I wonder if there’s some sort of event happening.

**Wataru**: Now now, please pay attention to my hand……☆

**Nagisa**: (…… This voice is-)

**Wataru**: One, Two, *Amazing*! A bouquet of flowers appeared from out of nowhere!

**Nagisa**: (…… It really is Wataru-kun. A splendid sight as usual.)

(…… Still, I wonder why he’s doing magic tricks in a place like this.)

**Wataru**: Now then, following this…….

Oh my? Oh my oh my oh my……? I never thought I would meet you in a place like this!

**Nagisa**: ……?

**Wataru**: That’s right! You who just looked behind yourself! I’m talking about you!

**Nagisa**: …… Could it be. You’re talking about me?

**Wataru**: Yes. It couldn’t be anyone but you. My close friend Nagisa Ran-kun ☆

Now, please give me your hand! Let me invite you to my stage.

**Nagisa**: (…… The audience’s gazes are focused on me.)

(…… Their faces say that they would not have even dreamed of me accidentally being in this place.)

(…… They must think this too is a pre-planned performance being carried out.)

(…… So the moment he called out to me, I was added to the lineup of performers on this stage…… In that case.)

…… I will gladly take that hand of yours, my friend.

**Wataru**: Fufufu, that’s how it should be……! Everyone, please give him a magnificent round of applause!

**Nagisa**: (Whisper) …… Wataru-kun, why are you doing magic tricks in a place like this?

**Wataru**: (Whisper) Fufufu. It’s just like you to ask for the meaning of my actions instead of asking for what you should do in this situation.

(Whisper) However, you can’t do that.

(Whisper) This is already atop the stage. For the sake of the audience of are impatiently waiting, now we must act as the finest jesters ♪

**Nagisa**: (Whisper) …… Maybe you’re right.

(Whisper) …… What they want to see is entertainment that would excite their own hearts.

(Whisper) …… What we should do right now is to answer to the expectations of the audience, not to comprehend the doubts I hold.

**Wataru**: That’s right. It saves me from trouble since you’re quick to reach a conclusion, Nagisa-kun.

Now then, even though this is an improvised stage, let’s make it a fun and delightful performance……☆

**Nagisa**: ….. Mm. So that just as the other day, we’ll show them that the audience won’t be able to avert their gaze from the two of us.

(Scene cut)

**Wataru**: Fufufu ♪ The stage was a great success.

Once again, thank you for taking part on the fly, Nagisa-kun. It was a really fun time☆

Nagisa; …… That’s my line.

…… Thanks to your invitation, I could have the valuable experience of being assistant to a magician.

**Wataru**: If it’s to your liking, what about standing on an even bigger stage next time?

As I had expected, Nagisa-kun has an aptitude for this. No, it might be more accurate to say that you’re prudent?

Even though we didn’t have any prior discussions, you quickly guessed the magic tricks I was about to perform and provided support.

It might have been a while since I was able to carry out an easy stage such as this one.

**Nagisa**: …… As for myself, I was just fumbling along, so I’m happy that you said that.

…… I was doing things based on what I thought you would do in those situations, Wataru-kun.

…… This isn’t the first stage I’ve been on with you, after all.

**Wataru**: Are you remembering “JNLC”? If I remember correctly, I did demonstrate a few magic tricks during practice.

**Nagisa**: …… You proceeded with today’s stage based on the magic tricks you showed me at that time, didn’t you?

**Wataru**: Oh my, so you did notice after all.

Even so, just because you memorised the magic tricks, being able to set up the support is a different story.

Sure enough, it worked out well all thanks to Nagisa-kun’s capabilities.

Well, even that Nagisa-kun would be a little bewildered at a magic trick you’re seeing for the first time!

**Nagisa**: …… Mm. Naturally, I wasn’t able to perfect the magic seed that allows things to float.

**Wataru**: It would be a disgrace as a magician if I let it be found out so easily☆

Even though you were on the stage as a performer, from my perspective, you’re also one of the audience members.

**Nagisa**: …… I see. As expected, you have your own motives, Wataru-kun.

…… This show certainly has meaning.

**Wataru**: Oh my, what are you talking about?

…… Just kidding, it’s pointless to play the fool when with you.

In that case, I will accept the role of the culprit. Would it be okay for you to let me hear your deductions?

**Nagisa**: …… As you are none other than Wataru-kun, there might be times where you will start a sudden street show.

…… However, I felt an intent from you that you were trying to prolong today’s stage somehow.

**Wataru**: Is that so? I was just putting on the best show so the audience that gathered would be satisfied.

**Nagisa**: …… From what I can see, you looked like you were waiting for something, Wataru-kun.

…… The answer lies within the seats of the audience. Because several times, your attention was directed towards a single seat.

…… It could be that child was the reason you started that stage.

…… Yes. Without a doubt it was that lost little one that was just reunited with their parents.

**Wataru**: Hmm. To sum it up, is that how it is?

…… I, Hibiki Wataru, found a little child who had been separated from their parents in front of the train station, and to make it so they would stop crying, I prepared this stage.

**Nagisa**: …… Then, by continuing to do magic tricks, a crowd would gather, and the child could be reunited with their parents.

…… As proof of that, when you had confirmed that the child had been reunited with their parents, you brought the curtain down on that stage.

**Wataru**: Amazing! As expected of Nagisa-kun ☆

I’m surprised that you’re able to correctly deduce the situation even though I haven’t talked to you about it all!

Surprisingly, Nagisa-kun has the makings of a detective.

**Nagisa**: …… I wonder. Even now, I’m inexperienced with reading the subtleties of people’s words.

…… If I had to say, I understood because it was Wataru-kun.

**Wataru**: Oh my oh my, you’ve said something that made me happy ♪

Now then, shall I do something to thank this Nagisa-kun who helped out with my show, and even put on a deduction show?

**Nagisa**: ……. I didn’t take your hand because I was expecting a reward in return.

**Wataru**: Now now, don’t say that. This is what is called give-and-take isn’t it?

For example…… like this.

How about spending some time with me until the time your next job starts?

**Nagisa**: …… So you understand. That I have too much time on my hands.

**Wataru**: Fufufu. That’s because I think I too understand because it’s Nagisa-kun☆

Now, I wonder where you will take me!

Or should I escort you?

…… Choose whichever, I promise you I will make it a wonderful time☆
