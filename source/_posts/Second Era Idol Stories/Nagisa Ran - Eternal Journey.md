(Location: Reception Room)

**Hiyori**: Hey Anzu-chan, I’ve been waiting for you!

Hm? What’s with your reaction? I’m welcoming you so you’d better appreciate it.

Come on everyone, loudly repeat after me! Good afternoon!

**Nagisa**: …… Good afternoon.

…… Anzu-san, is something wrong? You’ve been staring at us with a strange face for a while.

**Ibara**: It’s only natural. She was told only His Excellency and I would be present at this exclusive costume meeting, but when she showed up all of Eden were here.

**Hiyori**: Fufun♪ We’ve been waiting for Nagisa-kun’s exclusive costume for forever so we want to hear all about it!

**Jun**: Sorry about this guy’s selfishness surprising you. It is why we’re here, though.

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu. I’m happy to have you all here.

…… Anzu-san, sit here. Let’s discuss this together at once.

**Hiyori**: Yes yes, that’s good. Anzu-chan’s compiled all the exclusive outfits so far so let’s use those as a reference♪

**Jun**: Looking at them like this they have a lot of individuality~ Just by looking at them I can imagine who it’s for.

**Nagisa**: …… The exclusive outfit demonstrates the individuality, image, and ideals of each idol. I wonder if it’s made based on your background.

**Ibara**: Correct. And Anzu-san made this appointment so she could hear from His Excellency first before deciding what to base it on.

Eden as a unit is handled by this unworthy Saegusa Ibara. Since she doesn’t work with us regularly it’s only natural she would need more information.

**Jun**: You’re really going to say all that in front of her~? The exclusive outfits are pretty much all made by Anzu-san, so it’s no wonder she’d want to be in control of things.

**Hiyori**: Well that girl is simply nodding and agreeing, so those words don’t seem to have affected her much?

But the important thing here is what Nagisa-kun has to say! Nagisa-kun, what do you wish to see from your exclusive outfit?

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Eternal/8oco7mhd.png">

**Nagisa**: …… I don’t know.

**Hiyori**: ?

**Nagisa**: …… Normally, we need outfits that match the concept of our songs and lives. However, there’s nothing in particular that needs to be taken into consideration for the exclusive outfits.

…… Regardless of what costume I wear, I will still be the idol standing on the stage.

…… So it just needs to be a suitable outfit for me, one that is becoming of me.

…… As long as I put it on and go on stage, it will naturally become my exclusive outfit.

**Ibara**: — Ahaha☆ In other words you have the confidence to wear any kind of costume, as expected of His Excellency!

**Jun**: Eh, is that what he said? It felt like he just has no preferences to me?

**Ibara**: No matter what costume it is, if His Excellency dons it, “This is Ran Nagisa’s exclusive outfit” will be the subsequent end result.

**Hiyori**: Hmm…… But I want to hear more of Nagisa-kun’s thoughts. Anzu-chan, you also want to hear more from Nagisa-kun, right?

Even if it doesn’t have anything to do with your exclusive outfit, like… Something that left a strong impression on you recently or strong memories could give some hints maybe♪

**Nagisa**: …… Recent memories……

…… The location shoot we did at the zoo in Autumn was fun. The feel of the animals’ soft fur and the way they moved their mouths while they ate was adorable.

**Hiyori**: It was certainly a unique job for Eden, right?♪ I heard it was well received, so let’s look forward to a second visit in the future!

**Nagisa**: …… There’s also the time I discovered a dish called “overnight curry.” I had tried it out to see if it was really good or not.

**Jun**: Ah! That reminds me, there was that day where you offered us curry in the morning. The curry was delicious~♪

**Nagisa**: …… What else is there…? Recently, while we were in the car, Ibara—

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Eternal/2hqk8mws.png">

**Ibara**: Yes, certainly of course alright! Continuing this conversation could taint His Excellency’s dignified image so let’s stop!

**Hiyori**: Aw come on. Because you suddenly interrupted, Anzu-chan’s got a face like “I wanted to hear more.”

I guess it’s rare for you to hear these kinds of stories about our daily lives, right? Just ask me and I’d be happy to tell you all about it……♪

**Nagisa**: …… Is talking about what happened in the car no good?

**Ibara**: No, well… I was unsure if we’d get back on the topic of the exclusive costume if this kind of friendly banter continued.

…… If the conversation won’t progress further, from the standpoint of being Eden–and subsequently His Excellency’s– producer I would like to submit some design proposals for your consideration.

**Hiyori**: Hmm? If you had stuff like that you should’ve just brought them out at the start.

**Ibara**: I was waiting for the proper time to do so. Anzu-san also seems to be curious so I’ll proceed to show you all at once……

**Jun**: Woah, all of these fit with Nagi-senpai~. They’re so different from what you designed for my turn.

**Nagisa**: …… Since it’s Ibara, I figured he would come prepared. With the amount of designs, he really put his all into it.

…… I like all of these outfits. So, since Anzu-san is in charge of making it, as long as she approves I’d like for Ibara to choose for me.

**Ibara**: Me?

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. I’ll leave it to you.

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Eternal/j99ec04k.png">

**Hiyori**: — Now wait a second!

**Nagisa and Ibara**: ?

**Hiyori**: Even though it’s Nagisa-kun’s exclusive outfit, it’s Ibara choosing rather than you!

For my exclusive outfit, I left things up to Anzu-chan of my own free will. But with Ibara picking, isn’t it like you have barely any will in this at all, Nagisa-kun?

**Nagisa**: …… My will?

**Hiyori**: Yes. At least I want you to decide which of Ibara’s designs you’d say “this is good’’ towards. It’s an outfit meant to express your “self,” I want Nagisa-kun to choose it for himself.

By the way, I like design A the best, but maybe add some oomph to it, like additions to the shoulders and waist, and make the lines darker too to make it look better on stage!

**Ibara**: Haa…… You sure stir things up, Your Highness.

**Nagisa**: …… Sorry. However, I can’t ignore what Hiyori-kun said just now for my sake, so—

…… What do you think, Jun?

**Jun**: Nagi-senpai, why do you always direct difficult conversations my way……?

My opinion doesn’t really matter in this situation, but, ummmm…… Out of these I’d also go for design A.

But, they say the more you’re rushing the more you need to remain calm. You don’t have to decide right now, so why not take your time to think it through~?

**Nagisa**: …… Rushing will just lead to errors. Yes, Jun is right.

…… Could we wait until tomorrow?

…… I’d like to take some time to think and determine on my own which design I like best. I feel bad for Ibara and Anzu-san though.

**Ibara**: …… That’s fine, we can wait until tomorrow. I don’t wish to disrespect His Excellency’s will.

Let’s adjourn for today. I will handle arranging the meeting schedule, so I will see you all then.

# Chapter 2

(Location: Book Room)

(That night)

**Nagisa**: (…… I’ve been staring at the designs Ibara gave me for so long, but…

…… This is difficult. I don’t understand the feeling of having a “Eureka moment,” as I’ve heard it referred to. 

…… Although I’ve gotten more involved in Eden’s activities, I don’t know much when it comes to outfits.

…… I thought that by filling that gap I may be able to gain some sort of understanding, so I took to books and texts for answers.

…… But I can’t find a particular reason to say I like this one. I’m unable to find a basis for my feelings.)

…… Ibara put the design in a place where it would be the first one I see, so I suppose design A was also his preferred choice. I wonder why everyone preferred design A?

…… Perhaps it’s because they all have an image or ideal of what they want to see me wear and what appearance they want me to take on?

…… Then it seems everyone has an ideal for myself, except for me? 

………

(…… I wonder if it’s better to decipher why everyone liked design A instead of choosing which costume I like.

…… Perhaps through everyone’s ideals I can better understand who I am as an idol.)

**Ibara**: …… Pardon me.

**Nagisa**: …… Ibara? What’s wrong? It’s already so late.

**Ibara**: I was searching for you, Your Excellency. I heard you were considering the exclusive outfits again so I wanted to hand you the updated designs for your consideration.

However, seeing the books piled high and the designs spread out on the table, I can’t help but notice His Excellency seems to be having difficulty.

If you have any concerns regarding the outfits, I can take the time and explain the reasoning for each detail and addition.

**Nagisa**: Fufu, I’m curious but now doesn’t seem to be the time for it. I’m pondering the reason for why everyone preferred design A.

…… Because you all think it’s the best, then that would mean it’s the design that suits me best, right?

…… However, I’m unable to understand the ideal everyone sees in this outfit. If I can sort the reason out, then perhaps it would deepen my understanding of myself.

…… Ibara wished to proceed with design A as well. Why?

**Ibara**: So you noticed… Well, the answer is quite simple.

Of course, any design should align with His Excellency’s image, drawing out your unique presence and charm.

However, I decided and worked on the concept for design A first, so I feel a greater fondness towards it than the other designs.

**Nagisa**: …… Fondness?

**Ibara**: In simple words, I prefer it.

With the revisions from his Highness, as well as some from myself, the design is better than before.

Please consider the improved design in your deliberation!

**Nagisa**: …… Of course, thank you.

(…… Hm. It’s more eye-catching than before.

…… It feels strange to be asked what I wish to wear when I stand on stage, but…

…… I like this design.)

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Eternal/lkmuc3c8.png">

**Hiyori**: Ahh~! So you two were here!

**Jun**: Hey, it’s the middle of the night so please quiet down.

**Ibara**: What’s wrong, both of you?

**Hiyori**: There’s nothing to do about it. Since Nagisa was considering his exclusive outfit I wanted to be right there to consult with him!

It’s such a shame Ibara beat me to it first…… Hmm?

What Nagisa-kun is looking at is… a little different from design A, correct? With my suggestions reflected in it, it’s looking so much better……♪

**Jun**: Ibara really is a fast worker isn’t he~. It feels like Nagi-senpai’s tough presence has increased.

**Nagisa**: …… Do you both like the design?

**Hiyori**: Yep♪ Has Nagisa-kun decided on this design too?

**Nagisa**: …… Just now, I honestly felt like this is the outfit I prefer the most.

…… I want to stand on stage with everyone in the exclusive outfit that you all picked for me. I’m sure that’s the “me” that I’d be most happy with.

…… No matter which costume I pick, the idol who stands on the stage will be me.

…… After all, the costume that suits and is befitting of me is different for each stage.

…… I wanted to explore my appearance, embodied by donning this exclusive outfit, on stage. Like an idol would.

**Hiyori**: Great, I completely agree!

Unlike when you visit ruins or geological strata, we all stand together on stage.

**Nagisa**: ………!

**Hiyori**: Whatever it is you’re after, we’ll help you find it together, Nagisa-kun.

**Jun**: I’ll join you on your quest too, Nagi-senpai~. We’re going to make your exclusive outfit event into a real blowout, right?

**Ibara**: Yes, we’ve secured quite the generous budget. I’ve waited quite some time, you know~, for this victory and business opportunity!

Now that that’s settled, please contact Anzu-san at dawn—

**Nagisa**: …… There it is.

**Ibara**: ? What is it– where did you get that from?

**Nagisa**: …… From my pocket. Ibara, hold out your hand.

**Ibara**: My hand……? Alright.

<img src="/images/SecondEra/Eternal/afixzq41.png">

**Nagisa**: …… When I heard Hiyori-kun’s words–ruins and strata– something finally “clicked” in me. I want to entrust this stone to you, Ibara.

**Ibara**: It’s heavier than it looks. What is the name of the stone?

**Nagisa**: …… It’s just a nameless stone that I excavated from some ancient strata.

…… Could you incorporate this stone into my exclusive outfit? This time, I’ll leave it up to you on how to incorporate it.

**Ibara**: Understood! If it’s His Excellency’s wish, then this Saegusa Ibara will definitely live up to your expectations……☆

**Jun**: It’s rough, but it’s a pretty rock. Why do you want it in your exclusive outfit, Nagi-senpai?

**Nagisa**: …… The reason I went to the ruins was so I could learn about things I had yet to gain knowledge of.

…… By coming in contact with the unsolved mysteries of antiquity there, I hoped to answer the question, “What am I?”

…… So, by taking this stone I found during previous exploration with me as I head into exploration on the stage…

…… I thought I’d be able to pursue my “self” with even stronger resolve……

…… How’s that?

**Hiyori**: ……… (He holds Nagisa’s hand)

How wonderful! It was already the outfit that Nagisa-kun chose because he liked it, but now even your feelings can be felt through it!

I’m sure…… No– I know it will be an amazing exclusive outfit. Far beyond what we could ever imagine.

**Jun**: Haha, I’m getting excited too now~♪

When the four of us stand on stage together, even though it’s already done I feel like my outfit will naturally look even better.

**Ibara**: I’m sure we will feel a sense of completion as the stage comes together, and that it will refine how we view our outfits.

Oh, what kind of strategies will I devise for the unveiling and how will production be conducted? Ah, I can’t wait to begin☆

**Nagisa**: (…… Now that I’m thinking about it, whether or not there’s an exclusive outfit, I wonder if I would continue exploring on stage.

…… In any case, even more than before I want to stand up on stage in that exclusive outfit. I want to search and discover.

…… This is the first time I’ve felt such excitement in search of self-discovery. Ah, I want to know quickly. About the self that I’ve yet to discover—)
