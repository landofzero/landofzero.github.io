**Ibara**: Thank you for your hard work again today! Even I am proud that you’re so competent in all areas ☆

Since today’s recording emphasised on ad-libbing that wasn’t in the script, I was a bit worried myself. But it’s great that my worry was unfounded.

Here is some ice cream as refreshments from the tv programme’s staff. Would chocolate flavoured ice cream be fine with you, Your Excellency?

**Nagisa**: …… It’s ice cream. Thank you, Ibara. This is today’s reward isn’t it? I’ll accept it, then.

(…… Hurk!?)

**Ibara**: By all means, I look forward to your continued success in work tomorrow as well, Your Excellency!

**Nagisa**: ……

**Ibara**: Is there something wrong, Your Excellency? For some reason, you’re making a difficult expresion. Was it my ineptitude?

If that is the case, I will aim for improvement immediately, so please do not hold back in telling me the problem. This Ibara Saegusa will show you that I can overcome any difficulty if it is Your Excellency’s wishes. Ahahaha ☆

**Nagisa**: …… You’re being loud. Shut up a little.

**Ibara**: Heh…….!?

Eh? Y-your Excellency? Why are you angry, so suddenly? Have I really offended you somewhere?

If there is something, I will rectify it right now!? Right this moment! So please talk to me peacefully!?

**Ibara**: —And that was what happened.

**Hiyori**: Ahaha. That’s so funny. I guess Ibara was spooked by how intimidating Nagisa-kun was.

**Ibara**: This is no laughing matter. It’s been a few days since that incident, but His Excellency still hasn’t talked to me.

**Hiyori**: Hmm. So then, Ibara has come to me to ask the reason for Nagisa-kun’s anger?

**Ibara**: Exactly. As it is His Excellency’s day off today, I wanted to grab the opportunity to figure out the specifics.

**Hiyori**: I think there’s no need for you to be so nervous. It was just a ‘worm’ in a bad place. (2)

**Ibara**: Even so, I didn’t think that His Excellency would be so mad at me for that.

**Hiyori**: Fufu……

**Ibara**: Is there something wrong? This really is nothing to laugh about, Your Highness.

**Hiyori**: Nothing, I’m just thinking that this Ibara that’s panicking a lot more than I was expecting is really cute.

**Ibara**: No matter how much one knows, one has to be wary of landmines as one might not know where they might be buried.

Up till now, when I had angered His Excellency, I was able to figure out the cause to some extent. But this time, I could not even find a lead to the cause.

I can’t defuse the bomb properly, in this case.

Therefore, as Your Highness is the one who is the most knowledgeable about His Excellency, I implore for you to lend me your power!

**Hiyori**: ……Heh, Ibara is being unusually and admirably meek, aren’t you?

**Ibara**: If His Excellency’s mood continues to be bad, it might start to become a hindrance for our future activities as “Eden” and “Adam.

Thus, I have decided this incident should be resolved as swiftly as possible.

**Hiyori**: I see. Now I understand why you’re so desperate.

I do certainly know the reason for Nagisa-kun’s anger. So it would be absolutely correct for Ibara to seek me out.

**Ibara**: That’s quite fortunate! Well then, shall we—

**Hiyori**: However, it’s boring to just tell you so easily like that, right? Since you’re asking me for help, you have to show me your sincerity.

**Ibara**: Sincerity? How would Your Highness like me to demonstrate that? Would prostrating myself suffice? (3)

**Hiyori**: Fufun, I want Ibara to accompany me to go window shopping.

(Location: Shopping mall 1F)

**Hiyori**: Mmhm, I was able to get a variety of cute spring clothes. Lovely weather ♪

**Ibara**: It’s nice to hear that Your Highness is satisfied. However, this is such a luxurious way to spend your time.

**Hiyori**: You can only say it’s luxurious when you’ve managed to entertain me.

When I asked for preferences on clothes, you only gave me model answers. Even though you know the latest trends, in the end, you only talked about whether they will go out of style or get more trendy.

Talking with you isn’t exciting.

Since Ibara usually only works, I tried to teach you about noble games, but you can’t be taught at all.

**Ibara**: For me, work and producing results are like playing. Therefore, there is no need for Your Highness to worry about such things. Ahahaha☆

Putting that aside, isn’t it about time you tell me the reason for His Excellency’s anger?

**Hiyori**: Hm. Well, it’s fine. We’ve managed to kill some time, and you’ve even become something like a luggage carrier.

Well then, the reason for Nagisa-kun’s anger was it?

Fufu, the reason Nagisa-kun glared at Ibara is—

**Ibara**: That is……

**Hiyori**: Just a dental cavity.(4)

**Ibara**: ……Ha? Eh……Dental cavity?

**Hiyori**: To be specific, the reason was ‘a toothache’. It’s not confirmed to be a dental cavity just yet.

If I remember correctly, on the day he glared at Ibara, eating the ice cream refreshments he got from staff made him feel pain in his tooth.

But he thought that if he reported the pain to Ibara, his ice cream would be taken away and that thought made him grimace.

**Ibara**: …… Then, you mean to say the reason I’ve been worried sick up till now is just a dental cavity?

**Hiyori**: Nagisa-kun took a day off today because he made up his mind to go see a dentist.

Look, the dentist’s is right over there. Nagisa-kun should be going there today. The treatment should almost be over soon……

**Nagisa**: …… Hiyori-kun, you’re here to pick me up.

…… Eh? Ibara is here too? Why?

**Hiyori**: Sorry, Nagisa-kun. Ibara was really worried that he had offended you, so I spilled to him about the dental cavity.

**Nagisa**: …… Is that so? Sorry, Hiyori-kun, for causing you trouble. You too, Ibara. My teeth are fine, so you can rest assured.

**Ibara**: Is that so…… Yes. That is good news. It’s good that Your Excellency’s teeth are doing fine.

**Nagisa**: …… Ibara, I’m sorry about the other day. I spoke to you a little too harshly.

**Ibara**: I do not mind. Since I know of the reason for Your Excellency’s anger now, I can relax.

But, Your Excellency, I must apologise for my rudeness.

For the time being, Your Excellency is banned from any sweets whatsoever!

**Nagisa**: …… There’s no need to ban them. After all, it’s not a dental cavity, it’s just sensitive teeth.

**Ibara**: It doesn’t matter! Whether it’s dental cavities or sensitive teeth, the fact that you felt the pain is all the same!

**Nagisa**: …… The dentist also taught me the correct way to brush my teeth. With this, there are no other problems right?

**Ibara**: No, this is a definite decision! No matter what Your Excellency says, this decision cannot be reversed!

For the time being, I will be personally overseeing your mealtimes and your teeth brushing times.

I’ll even brush Your Excellency’s teeth myself!

**Nagisa**: …… Don’t get carried away, Ibara. I’ve told you this before, but I think it should be repeated. I’m your superior, Ibara is my inferior—

**Ibara**: That sort of threat won’t work on me this time. That’s because this time, I was the one unable to properly manage Your Excellency, leading to your ruin!

Lately I’ve been giving Your Excellency too much freedom. That’s why this chink in my armor was able to be put on full display for you.

**Nagisa**: …… What should I do, Hiyori-kun? Ibara is scarier than usual.

**Hiyori**: Seems like Ibara and Nagisa-kun’s positions are flipped now, huh? Getting in the way of this particular Ibara is kind of a bother, so you should run away with me when this happens, Nagisa-kun.

**Ibara**: I’m not letting you. I will never let this farce happen again! Never again!

TL NOTES:
<ol>
<li>Not a Christian reference, yet still a religious one. The title is a direct reference to a Buddhist analogy; Worms within the lion’s body. (source) The saying bears the meaning that ‘followers of Buddhism destroys it’s teachings just as worms born from the carcass of the lion devour the lion’. The story’s title however is a pun, as the first character for the original phrase is read as ‘religious leader’ but the first character for this story title is read as ‘lion’. Both are pronounced the same way. In this context, the ‘lion’ is Nagisa and the ‘worm’ is his tooth cavity.</li>
<li>He literally said ‘bug/worm’ ( 虫 ) The reason for which will be explained further down the story.</li>
<li>Dogeza.</li>
<li>Cavity/tooth decay = 虫歯. Written with the kanji for ‘bug/worm’ ( 虫 ) and ‘tooth’ ( 歯 ).</li>
