(Location: Arcade game center)

**Nagisa**: …… This is the game center?

**Jun**: That’s right~. Isn’t it lively?

**Nagisa**: …… On stage, I’m often exposed to loud noises and bright lights but…

…… This feels different. It’s like I’m drowning in waves of electronics.

**Jun**: Hmm. Are you getting overwhelmed? Do you need to take a breather?

**Nagisa**: …… No. I was just overwhelmed by experiencing such an environment for the first time.

…… I’ve gotten used to it, so I’m fine now.

**Jun**: If you say so. If you start feeling bad, don’t hesitate to tell me okay~? If something happened to you I’d get put six feet under.

**Nagisa**: …… Of course. It would be sad if Jun died. I’d be sad… as would Hiyori-kun and Ibara.

**Jun**: Haha, what about those two~? Well, I’ll be stubborn and keep living. There’s still a lot I wanna do.

…… Hm? Could that be Anzu-san?

**Nagisa**: …… Makoto-kun’s here as well. …… Ah, they noticed us.

…… Anzu-san, Makoto-kun. Good afternoon.

**Makoto**: Good afternoon~. You’re with Nagisa-san today aren’t you, Sazanami-kun?

**Jun**: Yep. That one next to you… Heeh, it’s just you and Anzu-san, huh?

So I guess that means you two are on a date this time♪

**Makoto**: Huh?! A date?!

**Nagisa**: …… Jun, what do you mean “this time?”

**Jun**: I’ve happened to witness Anzu-san and Yuuki-san walking with each other a few times—

At some point I overheard Trickstar say they’d take turns walking Anzu-san home.

But this location? And it’s just the two of you? …… You see what I mean?

**Nagisa**: …… I understand what you’re saying.

**Makoto**: I-It’s nothing like that! Nagisa-san, please don’t look so convinced with a smile like that!

We were on set together today and decided to hang out and have some fun afterwards~

**Jun**: Ahaha, I’m kidding♪ Thank you for your hard work.

**Nagisa**: …… Anzu-san, is something wrong? Is there a game you want to play with the four of us?

**Makoto**: Ahh. The dance game back there in the corner seems to be two v two.

I talked a bit about playing it with everyone the next time we all went to the arcade. If it’s okay with you guys, why don’t we play it together?

**Jun**: Sounds good~, I’m in! What about you, Nagi-senpai?

**Nagisa**: …… A dance game? I’d like to try.

…… I’d also like to team up with Anzu-san.

**Makoto**: With Anzu-chan?

**Nagisa**: …… Yes, if that’s alright with Makoto-kun. Jun and I already dance together frequently.

**Jun**: Even if we danced together, it wouldn’t be anything new. What do you think, Anzu-san?

**Nagisa**: …… You’re nervous that since I’m your partner you’d only drag me down?

…… It’s fine if you do. That’s why I’ll be there to support you. Isn’t that what cooperation is about?

**Jun**: Wow, you always say the coolest lines.

Let’s work together and do our best, Yuuki-san.

**Makoto**: Yep! Let’s do our best, Sazanami-kun!

(1 hour later)

**Nagisa**: …… This is the first time I’ve played something like this, but it’s very fun.

…… Most importantly, Anzu-san seemed like she was enjoying herself despite being nervous at first.

**Makoto**: Haah, I’m tired… Nagisa-san is so impressive, you didn’t even break a sweat.

**Jun**: For that guy, this kind of exercise is like a warm-up for his shoulders.

It sucks to end with a loss so why don’t we find another game and wrap things up on a high note?

**Makoto**: I agree. But what to do next…

…… Speaking of, Eden did a collab with a fighting game didn’t they? Why don’t we play that?

**Jun**: Ah! I completely forgot, that game was the reason we came here in the first place.

I was so busy that I procrastinated on checking it out and time passed so quickly… Then when I told Nagi-senpai that we should check it out soon—

He said he’d never played at an arcade here before, so I took him here.

Nagi-senpai, what do you wanna do? Are fighting games alright?

<img src="/images/SecondEra/NiceDay/tpjxdpeh.png">

**Nagisa**: …… I’d rather not. I want to look around the arcade some more.

…… Anzu-san, can you accompany me? It’s a large store so I’d probably get lost easily without help. Hm?

…… In the meantime, you want to take a picture of me looking around the arcade for the Feature Live?

…… Alright. Do as you please.

(10 minutes later)

**Nagisa**: …… This floor is full of glass cases with stuffed animals trapped inside.

…… Anzu-san, are these “crane games?”

…… I knew it. In the past Hiyori-kun had given me a stuffed animal before saying “I got it from a crane game.”

…… I see. This is…

………

…… I also want to get Hiyori-kun a present, but I don’t know how to play this. Do you know how to, Anzu-san?

…… Could you play as an example? Thank you– I’ll observe it as a point of reference.

…… Hm. So the arm moves once horizontally and once vertically, and you can use this button to decide the position.

……? The position was correct, so why didn’t it lift up a stuffed animal?

…… Hmm. So there are tricks depending on the prize, just aiming straight above won’t guarantee you’ll grab the prize.

…… I understand the gist of it, so let me try now.

………

…… I was able to grab the stuffed animal, but it fell along the way. The claw couldn’t bear the weight…

…… It’s more complex than I initially thought. How interesting.

(A while later)

**Nagisa**: …… I got two stuffed animals with chains at once. I didn’t know that could happen.

…… Alright. I’ve played all the crane games around here, let’s see what other prizes there are…

…… Huh? Ibara?

# Chapter Two

(Location: Arcade game center)

**Nagisa**: …… Look, Anzu-san. There’s so many Ibaras.

…… Fufu. To be exact, they’re Ibara stuffed dolls. Since I’m here, I might as well try to get one.

…… The Ibara that seems easiest to grab is… this child.

…… Isn’t it cramped inside that glass case? Come on over to me.

…… That’s strange… Even though the position was correct it fell right away.

…… Perhaps it’s set up to be hard to win?

………

…… Even so, it’s not impossible. I was able to move it a little bit, so there’s plenty of chances.

…… I won’t give up, because I’ve decided to take you home.

…… I don’t think the arm can withstand the weight of Ibara. Instead of grabbing Ibara, if I pushed it—

**Nagisa**: …… He finally fell. Fufu. I’ve caught you, Ibara.

…… Even though the appearance of the Ibara doll is different from that of the real Ibara, the characteristics are close enough to be seen as the same.

…… He’s soft and plush to the touch. Anzu-san, you can touch him too.

…… Fufu, I think I’m beginning to understand the feelings of our fans who go looking for our goods like this.

…… Shall we go see everyone soon, Ibara?

(Location: Downtown at night)

(A few hours later)

**Makoto**: …… It’s already night. I’m super hungry so I’m going to find a place to grab food.

Sazanami-kun and Nagisa-san, are you going to work now?

**Jun**: Yeah. Let’s have dinner together another time, though.

**Makoto**: Got it. Nagisa-san, do you want me to take that bag stuffed with plushies back to your dorm room?

It must be hard to carry around. It might just be none of my business though…

**Nagisa**: …… No, I’m fine. Thank you, though.

…… Ah, wait. There’s something I want to take out.

…… Anzu-san, I’ll give you this chain stuffed animal. Thank you for accompanying me today.

…… It’s the one I got two of at the same time. You’ll keep one half.

…… What should I do to thank Makoto-kun?

**Makoto**: Ahaha. You don’t have to. If you ever need help, I’m here for you.

**Nagisa**: …… Is that so? Understood.

…… Then if Makoto-kun is ever in trouble then just call for me. I’ll be there to help.

…… Also, don’t forget to take this with you.

**Makoto**: Wah– it’s a plushie of Saegusa-kun?!

**Jun**: Even though it’s Ibara it somehow has a cute face~? Nagi-senpai, did you win that too?

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. It’s a present for Hiyori-kun.

**Jun**: Haha. I’m looking forward to how Ohiisan’ll react to it.

Let’s get going then.

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. Goodbye, Anzu-san, Makoto-kun.

**Makoto**: Alright. Good luck with work♪

**Jun**: Take care, the both of you~♪

…… Nagi-senpai, are you just going to hold Ibara in your arms like that the whole time?

**Nagisa**: …… Is there something wrong with that?

**Jun**: There’s nothing wrong, it’s just that people might stare……

Whatever. Once we get to the main street all we have to do from here is take a taxi.

Haah, I gamed so much today. It was a nice change of pace~

…… It’s a little late for it now but would you want to come back to the arcade sometime, Nagi-senpai?

Ugh~ I’m worried Ohiisan might yell at me about how “It’s not educational! Jun-kun is a bad boy!” later though……

**Nagisa**: …… It’ll be alright. I told him that Jun and I went to the arcade.

**Jun**: Seriously?! What did he say?

**Nagisa**: …… Go have fun and enjoy yourself, he was smiling gently.

**Jun**: Really? Then I don’t have to worry—

…… As if. In that guy’s case he’ll probably get annoyed saying “Why didn’t you take me with you?!” 

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu. It’s because Hiyori loves you.

…… Next time, all four of us should go together.

**Jun**: Fine with me. That time it’ll be Ibara’s treat♪

…… Hm? Nagi-senpai, did your phone ring just now?

**Nagisa**: …… It seems like it. Speak of the devil and he shall appear, perhaps it’s Ibara?

………

………♪

**Jun**: Nagi-senpai, what did Ibara say?

**Nagisa**: …… It wasn’t Ibara, it was Anzu-san.

…… She sent me the pictures she took today. See, take a look.

**Jun**: Haha. It’s the first time I’ve seen someone look at a punching machine like that.

You also played a game where you hit a crocodile. …… Woah, an instrument sound game too.

Heeh, the arcade’s high scores were updated! It’s rare to see Nagi-senpai throwing up a peace sign, isn’t it?

**Nagisa**: …… I wanted to convey my joy through those photos, so I posed as Anzu-san instructed me to.

…… Is it strange?

**Jun**: No, no. It’s a little unfamiliar but it’s still good.

Nagi-senpai is Nagi-senpai, and you enjoyed the arcade. All the photos look good.

**Nagisa**: …… Yes, I think so too. …… Ah, it was fun.

…… Sometimes, days like this aren’t that bad.
