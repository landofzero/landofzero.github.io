**Mitsuru**: GOGO Team God!

Let’s fly away at full speed~! C’mon c’mon, Nagisa-senpai!

**Nagisa**: …… You’re full of energy, Tenma-kun.

…… Then, I shall “fly away” too♪

**Mitsuru**: Oh, that’s just like Nagisa-senpai. You’re so fast!

But I’m not going to lose! Babyuuun☆

Ahaha, this is fun♪ Bogie Time was fun, but I’m excited just thinking about what I’m gonna spend the extra money on!

I didn’t think I’d get bonus money from it so I don’t know what to do with it! I’ve been thinking about it when I’m in bed at night.

What do you like~. When you’re window shopping there’s so many interesting choices that it’s hard to decide, right?

Ah. How about these glasses? If I look like Saegusa-senpai then maybe I can become smart!

**Nagisa**: …… It certainly looks like Ibara’s frames.

…… Then, I wonder if I put on these sunglasses will I look like a celebrity?

**Mitsuru**: But Nagisa-senpai isn’t “like a celebrity,” you’re the real deal, right~? That’d be career fraud!

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu. It’s a God joke♪

**Mitsuru**: Ah, it was a joke? Sorry I didn’t notice!

Hm~. But it’s hard when it comes to spending money.

If you buy things in the spur of the moment, they’ll just add up and get in the way.

When I bought sneakers the other day, Tomo-chan told me “you only have two legs, so why are you buying so many?”

It had a cool design and was comfy so I just went ahead and bought it……

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu. I understand.

…… I’m often told the same thing by Ibara. I shouldn’t waste money.

…… That’s how it is. If money’s going to be going down the drain then I might as well spend it on experiences.

**Mitsuru**: Experiences?

**Nagisa**: …… Indeed. For example, have you tried buying something you wouldn’t normally buy?

**Mitsuru**: Hmmm. Yeah, it’s nice to have that special feeling.

Hm~. Experiences, experiences…… I can’t think of anything……

I want Nagisa-senpai to tell me what I should use the money for~……

**Nagisa**: …… What about using it for your hobby? If you use it for that, then it won’t be a waste. It will also be a “good experience for learning the value of the things you buy.”

…… In the case of Tenma-kun, you could buy new track and field equipment. With better tools, you can run even faster.

**Mitsuru**: For sure……

Ah, but that’s no good!

It’s bad timing since I just got new shoes……!

**Nagisa**: …… Oops. That’s too bad.

**Mitsuru**: Yeah, so disappointing~……

Other than that…… Maybe I’ll buy a big batch of my favorite bread? But one piece of bread is so cheap that I’ll still have most of my money left.

**Nagisa**: …… Then how about buying the tools to make bread?

…… If you know how the bread is made then it may taste more delicious.

**Mitsuru**: I specialize in eating, not making, so I’m not sure I can……!

**Nagisa**: …… It seems we’re blocked in every direction.(1)

**Mitsuru**: Sorry, Nagisa-senpai. You’ve been teaching me a lot but I keep saying no.

Uuu~, this money reward is too much of a burden for me after all!

**Nagisa**: …… Since it was a reward for us, I wanted Tenma-kun to decide how to spend it.

…… But it’s also bad to force you to choose something when you can’t decide.

…… If I were the one to use it, that’s it. Perhaps at that shop over there?

**Mitsuru**: Hmm? What kind of shop is it? Somehow, there’s a bunch of pretty rocks lined up!

**Nagisa**: ……This is a healing crystal shop. You can buy ores and accessories made with processed ore.

**Mitsuru**: You buy rocks?

**Nagisa**: …… Indeed. Collecting stones is my hobby.

…… Sometimes I pick up stones that have naturally separated from the earth, but it’s not uncommon to buy them like this.

**Mitsuru**: Huh. That’s kinda interesting.

They definitely have some beautiful stones. I might just pay for it♪

Nagsia: …… I’m glad you like it.

…… Stones are the history of the earth, and have been around far longer than humans. By gazing at the stone, you can think deeply for a long time.

**Mitsuru**: A long time…… That sounds like gibberish to me so I don’t really get it.

But this stone accessory is beautiful and has a nice feel to it.

**Nagisa**: …… Sunstone. It’s perfect for you, who’s like the sun.

**Mitsuru**: Is there such a thing as a perfect fit for the stone?

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. Stones have various meanings, like good luck charms.

…… Sunstone’s meaning is “leading everything to success.”

I’m not a superstitious person, but I’m sure you’ll have success in lots of things.That’s the energy I feel.

**Mitsuru**: Ehehe, what an amazing stone!

Thank you for telling me, Nagisa-senpai. I’ll try my best to stare at this stone and think for a long time!

Since the super knowledgeable Nagisa-senpai thinks a lot about it, I’m sure it’s important.

Since I’m also a member of Team God I’ll try to think more about things♪

**Nagisa**: …… I would like to thank you too. You truly want to learn more about things, it makes me want to teach you even more.

…… I’d be happy if this helped you take an interest in stones.

…… And if today becomes a touchstone for you, I’ll be even happier.

**Mitsuru**: “Touchstone”……? What’s that?

**Nagisa**: …… It’s nothing of note. I’m just talking to myself♪

**Nagisa**: …… Now that I’ve paid for it, you can pick something out for me next. Things related to your hobbies—like delicious bread♪

…… I heard that there’s a delicious bakery around here. Can you tell me your favorite shops?

**Mitsuru**: Of course! Just leave it to me!

Just like how Nagisa-senpai taught me, I can tell you all~ about my favorite bread☆

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu. He’s already running ahead. You truly are energetic, Tenma-kun.

…… If I eat bread, could I become like you?

………♪

TL NOTES:
<ol>
    <li>Nagisa is imitating Mitsuru here. The original phrase is “八方塞がり” but Nagisa replaces the first kanji with the katakana symbol “ハ,” which parallels Mitsuru doing the same thing in an earlier line. The phrase itself is akin to saying you’re “stuck with no way out.”</li>
