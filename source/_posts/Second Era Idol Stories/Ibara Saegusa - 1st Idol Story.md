**Season**: Spring

**Ibara**: Oya? Oyaoyaoya~?

Good evening, Producer-dono! How unexpected it is to see you at a place like this! Salute~☆

….. Ooh? Why are you laughing? Have I said something amusing?

It’s delightful, because I always want to put a smile on the faces of people around me! aHaHaHa☆

I see I see? You say that  lately the twins— those two from 2wink— have been mimicking me and saluting?

That’s why when you saw me, you thought ‘The actual person appeared!’ and it felt like it tickled your funny bone(1)?

Indeed! I understand! So it was just a strange callback joke.

It wouldn’t do for me to not extend my thanks to the two from 2wink by saying ‘Thank you for the introduction to the joke’!

Fufu. Those two are very convenient, they’re able to do anything to an astonishing degree, considering their past reputation.

Ah, it was a good decision to poach them, I had made a good purchase〜♪ (2)

I don’t mean to say this as a criticism. But something like the DreamFes system might have a harmful effect.

Because the Yumenosaki Academy judges idols based on a biased evaluation system——

There are a lot of sleeping bargains, like those two from 2wink.

Are there any more idols full of promise that seem to be slow in growing in Yumenosaki Academy?

If you happen to know of any, feel free to drop me a line any time!

Us at Cosmic Productions will show you that we will be hatching those slow-in-growing idol eggs magnificently! Salute~☆

If I were to get the provisions of information(3), I would thank you! Naturally! Because this world works through give-and-take〜♪ (4)

Yes! Dear me, there are also unsociable and difficult to interfere with idols in Cospro’s conglomerate(5)

Would it be convenient to arrange for you to produce for them?

(Well if that was possible, I’d be able to take control of CosPro and move it around as much as I want……

This is the result of me doing things by myself here and there.

A special producer, who goes between all the agencies…….

I’m not so foolish as to let a person from such a privileged class with strong influences run loose.

I will be chaining myself to you until you’re unable to think of me as nothing other than an eyesore.

I do work that is quite close to producing too, you see—— it can even be said that we’re business rivals.

Fufu. That’s why, inversely, I intend to be on friendly terms with you. Letting my poison deeply entangle, flow though, and dominate you……

I’ve always done it in this way, to bring down my prey and use them as my own provisions.

I will do the same to you. I will enjoy you deliciously……. Producer-dono♪)

**Ibara**: ……. Oops, how rude of me! I shouldn’t be staring at a woman so intently. Ahh, as usual, you’re so beautiful that my eyes were transfixed!

That is the lamentable habit(6) of men!

As I am also a humble idol, I would like to know the secret to that beauty!

As I thought, do you pay attention to your usual diet and such, and undergo beautification treatments?

I see, I see, it has nothing to do with beautification, but you take care to exercise like this every day? Being a producer needs stamina after all?

Wonderful! As expected, people who are highly praised do have a different way of thinking! How splendid!

Ju~st kidding, I’m doing the same thing and letting sweat flow a little after work!

Fufuu, while acting like I was praising you, I ended up singing my own praises! How embarrassing!

Yes! I’m the Vice President of Cospro, therefore during the day, I’m exceedingly busy with various things with managing the company!

Naturally, I have to give my all for idol activities as well!

And thus, for health, as well as for stamina like what you’ve just said…….

That’s why, I decided to exercsie in this training room after the sun has gone down.

Oh myy, so we’re the same! I’ve always thought that we were of the same mind!

I would be delighted if we could forevermore be intimately acquainted, salute~☆

Yes. Fufuu, since we’re working in the same workplace……. Let us get along well♪

Of course, if you’re not opposed to it!

Yes! Of course I will respect you as a producer while I’m working as an idol.

It’d be a blessing to be able to spend time together as friends during off hours like this!

You don’t mind? Ooh I’m so happy, perhaps it’s due to my weirdly overly friendly personality, but I’m not able to make close friends!

It’s so lonely〜 I want to meet up and have a friendly chat like this once in a while!

Also, I know quite a bit about delicious restaurants in this neighbourhood, so we should go on a food tour as a group one of these days!

….. Eh? If an idol and a producer were too close, won’t that cause a scandal?

Who told you something like that?

If it’s just having a meal with a producer, I think every idol does that……

Yes, CosPro has always at least set aside funds for things like entertainment expenses.

However! Please do not be hesitant to call me if you’re in trouble concerning food costs!

…… Oops. Even though the training room can be used till late at night, if we keep chatting too much, it’ll be time for it to close soon.

Let’s exercise like we originally planned to♪

If we don’t, it’ll be a waste of the usage fees! Eh, I’m surprisingly miserly, you say?

That’s a harsh criticism, but to not have any money is the same as not having a neck〜♪

Naturally, I’ll buy plots of land, or gems or anything else if it’s to please you♪ Ju~st kidding♪

(…… Fufun. Well, shall we leave it at that for today?

She almost refused to have a meal together… Somehow it seems like she’s a very guarded person.

She’ll be even more on guard with me if I were to push too strongly…….

From the beginning, Yumenosaki Academy is the opposition, and she would not have a good impression of me as I am someone with influence in CosPro.

Slowly and carefully, without hurrying or panicking, I will conquer you, Producer-dono♪)
