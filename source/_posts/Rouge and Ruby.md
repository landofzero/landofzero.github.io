(Location: Outside Ensemble Square)

(After SS, New Year’s)

**Jun**: Haah, hah…….

(Even though it’s New Year’s Eve… I still can’t skip out on my daily training~.

But my body is still sore from SS, so I’ll keep it light.

If I go around ES like this, then go back to the Starmony dorms…… Hm?)

Even though it’s New Year’s, why are the lights in the ES building still on? And what’s with them being lit on—

The 18th floor? Isn’t that where Cospro’s offices are?

Hmmm……

Now that I’ve seen it I can’t just overlook it. Let’s check out why they’re on~.

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/ofqaqgq7.png">

(Location: Cospro Offices)

**Ibara**: ………

**Jun**: What’s wrong, Ibara?

**Ibara**: ? That voice…… could it belong to Jun?

What are you doing here at this hour? Or rather, you shouldn’t have any business at the office on a day like this, so why are you here?

**Jun**: That’s my line. You look like you’re working as usual but……

Didn’t you say you can’t work during New Year’s because of the Labor Standards Act? 

**Ibara**: Ahaha, unfortunately the reality is quite the opposite. As Cospro’s deputy director, that law doesn’t apply to me.

**Jun**: I wouldn’t really brag about that… Plus we’re still recovering from SS.

It’s New Year’s so most people are giving their bodies a break.

**Ibara**: I don’t want someone who’s been working out on New Year’s to tell me I need to rest.

**Jun**: Hey, if it weren’t for me running I wouldn’t have caught someone breaking the rules and working, right?

**Ibara and Jun**: ………

**Ibara**: …… Haah. Now that SS is over I’ve decided to devote myself to my work. So could you leave me be?

**Jun**: But…… Don’t you know the concept of the start and end of a workday, Ibara?

The speed you’re typing at is impressive. Is there really that much work to do at the beginning of the year?

**Ibara**: Looking ahead, there’s an infinite number of things to do. And then—

You must have overheard what I was saying. I wanted to tackle SS head on.

If you bask in the afterglow then you’ll only be left with regret. Ah, damn it! To even think of such a thing.

However, if I devote myself to work then there’ll be no time wasted on sentimentality. Rather, the sentiment becomes my vitality.

**Jun**: It kinda sounds like you’re throwing your frustration into your work…… Well, whatever.

You’re a hardworking person. And only you can understand your frustrations, so I’ll leave you alone.

**Ibara**: …… Even though you said you’d leave me alone you appear to be sitting down.

**Jun**: Haha. I didn’t say I was going home, did I?

I’m also kinda curious about what you’re working on. It’s something relevant to Eden, isn’t it?

**Ibara**: Indeed. Some of these are looking far into the future while others need to be completed urgently……

This year, everyone in Eden will work and fully demonstrate their power as idols. 

**Jun**: Oh…… When you say it like that it makes me worry. With the work that’s coming up next……

**Ibara**: As a large-scale event that spans all of ES, we can’t stand to ignore next month’s Valentine’s Day Chocolat Fes.

**Jun**: Chocolat Fes…… Hmmm. Isn’t that supposed to be the event held all at once across the country’s idol schools?

**Ibara**: Yes. Although it’s usually held at the same time across multiple idol schools, this year it will be held at ES. 

**Jun**: Even though idol schools all over the country participate, it’s something Reimei and Shuuetsu have no connection to so I don’t really understand it~……

Actually, why aren’t Cospro-linked schools participating in Chocolat Fes?

**Ibara**: To put it simply, it wasn’t worth it. 

However, it’s not as if we didn’t participate whatsoever. A small number of students, usually scholarship students, would join the performances in some way.

**Jun**: Eh, this is my first time hearing of this…… Did you manage all that?

**Ibara**: I was the manager for it.

**Jun**: The manager, or just someone in power….

But there’s the fact that it’ll be held at ES. Does this mean we’ll participate in Chocolat Fes this year too?

**Ibara**: Of course. Since it’s being held at ES for the first time, it’ll naturally attract a lot of interest and attention from the public.

Additionally, most of the units in ES will be participating as well. There is no way Eden can’t have a presence among them.

I’m carefully and meticulously considering the arrangement.

I’ll share more details later, so please be patient.

**Jun**: Alright. I don’t know what you’re thinking, but I’ll wait for you~♪

So, when are you going home, Ibara?

**Ibara**: Excuse me?

**Jun**: Look at the clock.

I know you’re in a good mood but isn’t it not really a good idea to be working overtime late on New Year’s?

**Ibara**: …… Don’t concern yourself with that, I’ll return to the dorms at a reasonable time.

**Jun**: I’m telling you this because I doubt you will. Why don’t you run to the dorms with me?

**Ibara**: You’re wearing clothes suitable for exercising, I’m not. I’ll have to decline.

**Jun**: Ahaha, is that how it is?

Anyway, please finish up soon and get back to the dorms. If you don’t come back any time I’ll come back to ES to check on you.

**Ibara**: Are you being overprotective? I’ll wrap things up when I finish this.

**Jun**: Alright…… Please do it properly, okay?

# The Circumstances of the Second Month

## 1

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/3ijo40xi.png">

(Location: Inside company car)

(Some time passes, after shooting a live video for COMP)

**Nagisa**: ……\~♪

**Ibara**: You seem to be in a good mood, Your Excellency. Did something good happen?

**Nagisa**: …… Nothing in particular.

…… After this I’ll be working with Hiyori-kun and the others, so maybe that’s why my heart is bouncing a little.

**Ibara**: Oh really?

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. After New Year’s, Adam and Eve have been doing a lot of separate work.

…… So it’s only natural that I’m happy to be working as Eden again.

**Ibara**: Oh really?

**Nagisa**: …… During the SS qualifying rounds, I made Hiyori-kun feel lonely because I wasn’t there.

…… If we only work as Adam and Eve then I’ll miss spending time with Hiyori-kun.

**Ibara**: Is that so?

**Nagisa**: …… I would be happier if we could work together more. Looking at the schedule, it seems that both units will continue working separately.

…… How can we spend more time together? If I make a direct request to you, Ibara, will Eden get more work?

…… Instead of the usual mechanical backtracking, I’d like to hear a proper explanation in Ibara’s own words.

**Ibara**: —Hold on, you’ve nailed my mouth shut before I could even open it.

**Nagisa**: …… If I didn’t do that then you would have tried to deceive me by saying “I don’t know about that.” 

**Ibara**: Ahaha☆ That’s certainly something I would say.

However, it’d still be an explanation. Eden’s work comes in on a case-by-case basis, and it’s not like we’re unable to spend time together in private.

As you said, it’s clear that the work for Adam and Eve is increasing, but……

**Nagisa**: …… Then tell me why. Ibara, what are you thinking by increasing the exposure and activities of those two units?

**Ibara**: Do you have something in mind already, Your Excellency?

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. When you ask us to move differently than usual, I can’t think that it’s for no reason.

**Ibara**: Well, it’s clearly indicated on the schedule so it’s reasonable that you’d have questions…… Is that what you’re saying?

First and foremost though, I’d like to reassure you that this has no hints of the division and confrontation upper management has included in their plans in the past.

**Nagisa**: …… Of course. If such an intention were to appear though, I’d have you confess to it before I could ask.

**Ibara**: Confessing sounds dangerous.

Regardless, if you understand the point then there’s no issue because……

While continuing activities as Eden, there is a plan in progress to increase the exposure of Adam and Eve.

**Nagisa**: …… A plan?

**Ibara**: I have a plan for a certain event that’s currently in its preparation period. That’s why……

I’m sure that His Highness and perhaps Jun also have the same question Your Excellency has. So—

**Nagisa**: …… Is there no point to explaining right now?

**Ibara**: Although it’s not making sense, it’d be a hassle to have to explain this again to His Highness and Jun!

So I’d like to explain this when Eden is gathered together. That way, I can hear everyone’s opinions.

**Nagisa**: …… Hmm. If you have good reasoning and are willing to listen to us then that’s fine.

**Ibara**: Oh? Are you sure?

**Nagisa**: …… It was Ibara who said he’d explain when we’re all gathered. I just accepted those words.

…… Additionally, it was because of my personal anger and vengeance that I stole Ibara’s happiness during SS.

…… Recently, you’ve been saying things like “Benevolence~♪.” I hadn’t allowed you to fight the war you love so much.

…… Even if it isn’t a proper apology, if Ibara has a plan he really wants to do, then I’ll go along with it properly.

**Ibara**: ………

—It seems His Excellency has learned to be “worried sick.”

Are you saying you’re suddenly aware of the trouble you’re causing? Because to me I’m always being cluelessly swayed around.

**Nagisa**: …… Did I cause that much trouble for you?

**Ibara**: Ah this is giving me déjà vu! It was simply difficult, so please refrain from asking.

It’s enough for me to know His Excellency is following my course.

**Nagisa**: …… Is that so?

…… Then I’ll quietly wait for your explanation.

**Ibara**: (As he said, he really does want an explanation from me…… It seems the conversation has ended though, now that His Excellency’s opened up his book.

However, even if the events of SS are one of his reasons, it’d be helpful if His Excellency took the stance of accepting my proposals.

…… And all that leaves is Eve. Assuming Jun is fine with things, all I need to do is figure out how to best convey my plan to His Highness.

Well, if something goes wrong then I’ll need to do something about that first.

That this is a plan for Eden, that the content conveys Eden’s authority… I’ll need to find the proper words to show those aspects off.)

(Location: TV station lounge)

(After an Eden music program recording session)

**Hiyori**: Ah, that was fun! Talking and singing together is the best after all!

There’s a unique sense of fulfillment that only comes from working together as Eden……♪

**Jun**: I think the recording turned out good too. You’re super energized aren’t you, Ohiisan?

**Hiyori**: Of course, after all the four of us working together is just delightful, right?

That’s why there’s so many things I want to do. Since the New Year, Adam and Eve have been taking way too many separate jobs.

**Jun**: I also agree with you on that. Tomorrow and the day after that, I’ll be on location with you.

**Hiyori**: What? Are you saying you’re unsatisfied with being on location with me?

**Jun**: No no, I’m talking about the workflow of the units. 

I’m just feeling a bit stressed so can you not hit me please~?

**Hiyori**: Hmph. I don’t like how Ibara is scheduling our work without any kind of explanation either!

I’m sure you have an idea behind it but couldn’t you at least explain it? What foul weather!

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu. Hiyori-kun, you’re talking like me.

**Hiyori**: Eh?

**Nagisa**: …… I asked Ibara what he was thinking in the car on the way to the TV station.

**Hiyori**: Oh, is that so? Fufu, Nagisa-kun and I are inseparable even when we’re apart……♪

**Nagisa**: …… Yes, we have a telepathic connection.

**Hiyori and Nagisa**: ………☆ (High five)

**Jun**: (Whispering) Wait a sec. The seniors are getting all buddy buddy. But you, why are you being so quiet?

**Ibara**: (Whispering) It’s not like that. I’m simply watching them get along with a smile……♪

**Jun**: Liar\~…… If you started talking at the wrong time, you’d get caught up in their talk so I guess you’re just watching and waiting.

**Ibara**: If I were to insert myself into a conversation between His Highness and Jun, or His Highness and His Excellency- I feel like such an action would be tasteless.

I was not directly asked to explain, so I don’t think I need to interrupt them.

**Hiyori**: Don’t you forget that!

The reason I didn’t ask was because I assumed there was something going on so I did my absolute best to put up with it. I wanted so badly to say “Explain this right now!”

**Ibara**: …… I don’t think I want to hear that while you’re high fiving and holding hands. But thank you for your consideration.

For the time being, until a request for it comes in…… or something like that, I thought I’d explain after I’d laid a certain amount of groundwork.

If it’s something only I know about then I can move it along at my own pace. Additionally, it was also more convenient to just stay silent.

**Nagisa**: …… In the car, you said you’d explain when Eden is gathered. Is now not a good time?

**Hiyori**: Is that what he said? Then why don’t we hurry along and get to it, all four of us are here so it’s perfect timing.

**Ibara**: The time isn’t bad, but this isn’t the right place to talk about it.

I can’t show any materials here, and most importantly we can’t occupy this changing room forever. We haven’t even changed out of our costumes yet.

**Nagisa**: …… Right. We should have changed out of our costumes first, Hiyori-kun.

**Hiyori**: Yes, that’s true. I just got excited, but changing clothes is the priority.

**Jun**: (While starting to change) …… Actually, I have an idea of what Ibara wants to talk about.

**Ibara**: You do?

**Jun**: Yeah. Something to do with Chocolat Fes. You said you’d give more details later back at New Year’s.

**Hiyori**: ?

**Ibara**: …… Ah, when we spoke on New Year’s? Now that I’m thinking about it, I do remember something like that.

**Nagisa**: ?

**Hiyori**: What are you two talking about?! Before I knew it, you two were keeping secrets from us?

I can’t believe Jun and Ibara left us out of it. This is a big deal, Nagisa-kun. It’s depressing to have secrets kept from me……!

**Nagisa**: …… I don’t think they were trying to leave us out, but if Hiyori-kun is sad then I am too.

…… Ibara, could you clarify?

**Ibara**: (Whispering) …… It’s Jun’s fault. I was procrastinating on telling you all so I could continue moving at my own pace a little while longer.

**Jun**: (Whispering) You threw the subject back to me, didn’t you? Can you not blame just me for once?

**Ibara**: …… Even if you ask me to explain, as I said before, this is not the best place to do so.

I’ll arrange a time for us to properly meet at the office at a later date.

**Nagisa**: …… I’ll be fine as long as Ibara tells me the time and date. What I want to know is what happened on New Year’s.

**Jun**: It’s not like it was a special event or anything.

I was going for a run on New Year’s and noticed the ES building lights were lit on the 18th floor.

I was curious and went to check it out and it turns out Ibara was working. So we just chatted for a bit.

**Hiyori**: You were training the day after SS, weren’t you Jun-kun? And Ibara, even though it was New Year’s you were working as usual!

**Nagisa**: …… I know you two were training, but I’d like it if you both took a break.

**Ibara**: Don’t concern yourself with it, Your Excellency. I was advised to rest at an appropriate time.

**Jun**: And after telling him that, this guy started hitting his keyboard with shocking speed.

…… Ah, could it be… 

Had you been preparing for that COMP shoot a while ago since the beginning of the year?

**Hiyori**: Ah… It was a sudden shoot, it had me wondering when it was even prepared. While the world was busy celebrating New Year’s, Ibara was busy laying groundwork wasn’t he?

**Jun**: He was saying it was a rough plan or something like that. If it’s to refine that, I guess he’s willing to give up his day off and work.

**Nagisa**: …… Ibara’s been moving around a lot. But, this has something to do with Chocolat Fes, right?

…… Does this mean the preparations Ibara’s been progressing through has something to do with our activities?

**Ibara**: Aah well, you have too many questions! I don’t particularly care at the moment so interpret it as you like.

Or rather, I said I would explain it another day, didn’t I? So no more questions! Denied!

Come on, let’s hurry up and get dressed! I’m arranging for a car to pick us up so no slacking!

(Location: CosPro office conference area)

(At a later date)

**Ibara**: —It’s a miracle. I’m glad everyone managed to get here on time♪

With this I smoothly segue into the explanation. First of all, please read these materials I prepared in advance.

**Hiyori**: What’s all this? Chocolat Fes will be held at ES for the first time……

**Ibara**: Indeed. To begin, I will quickly explain what Chocolat Fes is so please read the briefing.

…… However, we will not be participating in the same Chocolat Fes that’s been held across the country.

This year, ES will be hosting Chocolat Fes for the first time. As such, even if the name is the same, there’s no need to base what we do on the previous years.

**Jun**: So that’s why the reading is so light. Hmm……

**Nagisa**: …… Various units from each office will be participating in this Chocolat Fes.

…… And since this is being held at ES, even if they have experience from participating at Yumenosaki Academy, in a way it’ll be those unit’s first time appearing together.

**Ibara**: Indeed, this “first” is very important.

With the first appearance of each unit lined up, I hope to achieve results that are unrivaled by everyone else. As the face of the event, Eden will be remembered by the masses.

**Hiyori**: That first time is special, isn’t it? The first impression is important and the first performance will be talked about long afterwards.

**Nagisa**: …… If you visit a temple for the first time after New Year’s it’s deemed Hatsumode

**Jun**: That’s one of those things too\~ Come to think of it, I’m getting the impression that “firsts” are generally thought of as special.

**Ibara**: That’s why it’s of great importance that we get results from this Chocolat Fes.

Additionally, while demonstrating our authority as Eden, it’s imperative that the other units under CosPro that participate also produce results.

…… So far, only 2wink has replied to my request to make an appearance.

**Hiyori**: They’re also students of Yumenosaki Academy, so I wonder what they’ll do in terms of the school’s Chocolat Fes.

From what I’ve read, it seems the schools will still hold their version of Chocolat Fes as usual.

**Ibara**: They decided to participate in both. Since they take place on different dates, doing both is possible.

**Jun**: 2wink are very motivated, aren’t they~

**Ibara**: Well, the Yumenosaki Academy Chocolat Fes was initially doubtful. Even if it’s not possible to hold it at Yumenosaki, there’s still ES—

Which is part of the reason I’ve wanted to participate in ES’s Chocolat Fes since the beginning.

Now that the school’s Chocolat Fes is in sight, 2Wink is en route to doubling their profits.

**Nagisa**: …… (Raising his hand) I have a question.

**Ibara**: Go ahead, Your Excellency.

**Nagisa**: …… What did you mean by Yumenosaki’s event being doubtful? I’m curious as to how much you know about Yumenosaki Academy’s affairs.

**Ibara**: It’s hard to explain concisely but…… This year it seems the confectioner hired for Chocolat Fes was having difficulties—

There were requests to postpone since it became difficult to supply the chocolates as usual.

However, from the standpoint of His Eminence Eichi, the heir to the Tenshouin conglomerate, who also holds the majority of Yumenosaki Academy’s capital……

He likely wanted to avoid hiring alternative confectioners other than the one that had been supporting the academy for years to avoid any rumors.

Therefore, due to these difficulties Chocolat Fes was put on hold.

**Hiyori**: Hm? But since there’s prospects for it to be held now, did Eichi-kun do something?

**Ibara**: Yes. It’s a powerful technique that can only be done by the Tenshouin conglomerate.

**Jun**: It’s good that it’s able to be put on though, right? A lot of people were looking forward to the event.

**Ibara**: That’s right. I’m also glad that His Eminence has resolved the issue.

Thanks to that, fine, led by his Eminence, has been able to focus on the Chocolat Fes derivative event: Primavera.

**Hiyori**: Ah, Ibara is looking oddly cheerful. You must be thinking something bad!

**Ibara**: Something bad? No no, I pale at the thought!

…… The powerhouse unit fine has no choice but to focus on a stage other than Chocolat Fes.

Even if they participated in Chocolat Fes, its level of priority will definitely be lower than Primavera.

In other words, we can go into Chocolat Fes with one less enemy to face! Our chances of winning are increasing!

I am determined for Eden to win— we can’t let such an opportunity pass by!

**Jun**: Ibara, your true intentions are coming out\~

**Nagisa**: …… He doesn’t want to miss a battle he can easily win. The desire to win must be that strong.

…… So Ibara was preparing for Chocolat Fes while gathering information on Yumenosaki’s side through Eichi-kun.

**Ibara**: Precisely! It’d be nice to win even if I get called thoughtless and reckless in the process.

While His Eminence handled Yumenosaki’s side, ES’s side was something I intended to take charge of since last year.

…… I’m not just slithering on the ground, but underneath the water as well.

**Hiyori**: Unbeknownst to us, that venomous snake was running around.

**Jun**: He does that all the time. Even when there’s other jobs going on like SS.

**Ibara**: It’s not hard to work for the sake of one’s own ambitions, especially when victory is in sight.

**Hiyori**: Hmm. I can tell how much Ibara wants to win Chocolat Fes as Eden.

But isn’t Chocolat Fes supposed to be a wonderful event about love? It doesn’t sound like something that’d have winners and losers.

**Nagisa**: …… What is it that makes Ibara assume that there’ll be sure victory?

…… I also heard the words “take charge.” I haven’t heard any explanation about ES’s Chocolat Fes yet.

**Jun**: I still don’t understand why our work is being split into Adam and Eve all the time.

**Hiyori**: Oh yeah. Is that matter related at all to Chocolat Fes at all?

**Ibara**: In order to explain this step-by-step, I’ll answer His Highness’s question first.

**Hiyori**: Oh really?

**Ibara**: In order for us to show off our authority as Eden as much as possible……

In order for Eden to be the most visible, to liven things up, to attract attention, to gain fans, and to gain support from the public—

This Chocolat Fes, we will be divided into Adam and Eve and have both stand on stage.

## 4

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/w5mpi9l1.png">

(Location: CosPro office conference area)

Jun and **Nagisa**: ………?

**Hiyori**: None of that’s clicking, say it in more detail!

**Ibara**: I would like to set up a stage where Adam and Eve can perform during Eden’s turn, and then at the end Eden can all perform together.

I want to use our unique structure, in which two units combine to form Eden, as part of my strategy.

**Nagisa**: …… I see. Eden’s duration is split between Adam and Eve.

…… Is the current increase in exposure for Adam and Eve a stepping stone for that plan?

**Jun**: During Conquest we had worked separately a lot. It’s been a while since then hasn’t it~?

There’s also SS, so Eden’s impression should come first.

I think it’s a good idea to appeal to the public with how we’re structured.

**Hiyori**: If they don’t understand how we’re structured, then they’ll be asking “why are they coming out two by two?”

**Ibara**: Currently, I’m focusing on working as Adam and Eve, but as Chocolat Fes approaches I plan to switch my focus to  increasing Eden’s exposure.

In other words, we will put in the work to properly show that the two form Eden.

As His Highness said, if we don’t convey our structure then the stage performance will be meaningless.

**Jun**: Hm\~…… So is this the preparation phase to make use of our unique strengths for Chocolat Fes?

**Hiyori**: It can be interpreted that way. That was a fine summary Jun-kun!

**Jun**: Ibara prepared a lot of materials and I was listening pretty seriously, so I understand that much.

**Hiyori**: Now that Jun-kun and I have cleared up our doubts…… The next thing is to answer what Nagisa-kun asked about.

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. In order to fully understand ES’s Chocolat Fes I’d like you to explain its structure.

…… Um, I’d like to know what makes Ibara so sure that Chocolat Fes will result in victory.

**Ibara**: Aye aye!♪  Then, please see the materials I handed out—

(A while later)

**Jun**: Each unit will sell chocolate and goods, and the sales will be reflected in L$?

**Ibara**: Correct. The sales at Chocolat Fes will be quantified, so in other words whichever unit sells the most units will be considered the victor.

**Hiyori**: Eh~ in the end it’s all about money? There’s no dream behind it– I hate that.

**Ibara**: Even if you hate it, that’s just how ES’s Chocolat Fes will operate.

Rather, it’s a fairly helpful design. For the chocolates and goods, ES will aid units with setting up the basics.

**Nagisa**: …… It’s written in the document. It says for each unit you can prepare items with different packaging and designs.

**Jun**: That sounds pretty generous~ Even if the contents are the same, if the packing is different then it’ll seem like they got items from that unit.

**Hiyori**: The fact that all the contents are the same means that all units are equal, but……

I don’t think Ibara would be satisfied with having the same items as others, even if he’s already set us apart with a special stage production.

From what I’ve heard so far, it sounds like Ibara is planning on outperforming everyone, aren’t you?

**Ibara**: …… Although there is some dissatisfaction, let’s keep it up for evaluation for now. Please read the notes at the bottom of the page carefully.

**Nagisa**: …… “On the condition that they bear the cost themselves, units may plan and produce products independently.”
image

**Ibara**: Fufun. That’s a sentence I added after some negotiations with ES’s side……☆

**Jun**: Uwah, so sneaky\~. There’s only so many units that can do something like that.

**Ibara**: It’s precisely because we can proudly do such a thing that I added it!

**Nagisa**: …… Ibara, you also own a confectionary company. With that we can have chocolate be made exclusively for Eden.

…… I’m looking forward to seeing what kind of chocolate it will be……♪

**Hiyori**: Fufu, Nagisa-kun loves chocolate, right?

I’m also starting to look forward to it now that I know the chocolate will be just for us……♪

**Ibara**: —What is victory? It simply means that we as Eden will stand at the top of Chocolat Fes.

However, I apologize for overturning what I said earlier. If we want sales, then we’ll need to develop a sales strategy.

Increase sales and generate profits through chocolate. We are the ones who will be attracting the most attention from customers and generating the most excitement on stage.

Both in terms of numbers and people’s feelings, this Chocolat Fes I can only foresee that Eden will come out on top, securing victory.

**Jun**: The point is, if we want that victory, then we’ll have to follow Ibara’s plan.

**Ibara**: Yes, please do your best.

I’m– no, we will surely seize victory for this year’s Valentine’s Day.

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/ssvke9v2.png">

(Location: Staff dining hall)

**Jun**: …… Oh. You’ve done a good job of balancing your food today.

If you only had chicken breast and broccoli on your plate then I would have put my fried chicken on your plate.

**Ibara**: If I don’t fill my plate up enough then you all will get unnecessarily concerned about it. So I filled it myself.

**Hiyori**: Now everyone, let’s sit down quickly and say thanks.

Thank you for the meal……♪

**Nagisa**: …… Thank you for the meal.

**Ibara**: …… Now that I’ve finished explaining everything, we can have lunch. I didn’t have time to set up a Q&A.

If you all have any other impressions or opinions, please let me know.

**Hiyori**: When you say impressions…… What are you looking for?

To be honest, I think it’s horrid that winning or losing through money is involved in an event that’s supposed to be about something as wonderful as love.

Adam’s fans, Eve’s fans, and Eden’s fans. As long as it’s a gift from us, everyone will be happy.

While taking advantage of that excitement, I wonder if I’d be able to meet with a few fans. If so, then I wonder if I’ll be able to give my love out to swathes of people.

Personally, I think it’s good.

**Ibara**: Your Highness seems reluctant to be splitting work as Adam and Eve, so I appreciate you saying that.

**Hiyori**: If there’s a proper reason behind it and love is present, then I’m convinced.

**Nagisa**: …… Yes, I also agree. Although I think working as the two units will inevitably remind me of Conquest.

…… I’ve been reassured by Ibara that he doesn’t intend to make the fans worry unnecessarily.

…… I will follow Ibara’s will to make everyone happy and lead us to the top of Chocolat Fes.

**Ibara**: …… I’m honored, Your Excellency.

**Ibara**: ………

**Jun**: What’s wrong? You’re being quiet.

**Ibara**: Hearing positive words from His Excellency and His Highness has lifted a weight off my shoulders, that’s all.

It usually takes a lot of effort to persuade those two, so to get a positive reception from the start is relieving.

**Hiyori**: I don’t think you should say that in front of us!

**Nagisa**: …… Ibara’s plans don’t usually go as they were originally meant to.

**Hiyori**: Ah, is that the case?

It’s surprisingly cute for Ibara to be relieved when he gets approval……♪

**Ibara**: Please refrain from teasing me!

I’m relieved that I didn’t get more work pushed onto me.

…… Valentine’s Day is far from being a day for love, it’s also a major sales season for confectioners. It’s an event that must be won at all costs.

That’s why, as a manager…… and as an idol participating in Chocolat Fes…

Since last year, I’ve spent a lot of time preparing myself for victory and success. So, yes, I feel relieved.

**Jun**: Heeh…… To be honest, when I met with you on New Year’s I thought it was just your frustration from SS motivating you.

I’m glad you didn’t turn attention to this just because you couldn’t do what you wanted back then.

**Ibara**: Hmph. It’s true that I want to make up for SS, but…

**Jun**: But?

**Ibara**: — What but a damper on that was a complicated project, COMP.

It was a plan for the idol training schools affiliated with CosPro, as well as ES’s hidden intentions. As the deputy director, I couldn’t ignore it.

**Hiyori**: But we shot a promotional video for it, didn’t we? Isn’t that the end of it?

**Ibara**: Yes. But there’s still some budget left over, and it’d be odd for upper management to not take advantage of that surplus.

**Nagisa**: …… The fact that there’s still some budget left means it must have been generous.

**Ibara**: That’s right, there’s enough left that it can be distributed to each CosPro unit to use for their stages.

Therefore, upper management has the explanation that the budget will be used to boost each CosPro idol’s performance at Chocolat Fes.

It has something to do with creating an interest in CosPro affiliated idol schools.

**Hiyori**: But, would it be able to create that lead?

**Ibara**: It depends not only on the strength of the unit, but also their ability to solidify their foundation.

…… I want to put all my effort into my own plans, but I wonder if I’ll have to do work for the higher ups as well.

It’s giving me a headache.

**Hiyori**: Is that something we can’t touch on? I hate the idea that a day of love is getting tied up in adult agendas.

**Ibara**: If I could ignore the wishes of the upper management then I wouldn’t be complaining.

**Jun**: ………

**Ibara**: We have to make good use of it and make the audience view CosPro as good. I have to convince the higher ups and give them a sense of satisfaction.

But it’s easier said than done.

How much effort will I have to put in to get to that point?

**Jun**: ………

**Ibara**: —By the way, Jun, you’ve looked deep in thought for a while now. Is there something you want to say?

Come to think of it, I’ve yet to hear your opinion, so I’d like to hear it.

**Jun**: Umm, ah……

I don’t know if this is a good idea to say to you when you look so worried.

—I’m against it.

**Ibara**: …… You’re against it?

**Jun**: Chocolat Fes is an event for Valentine’s Day, isn’t it?

On the other hand, COMP…… COMP is a project that I don’t really like in and of itself.

But, even without my personal feelings……

I guess it’s because they want to show off that hellish place and make it seem better but…

It has nothing to do with Valentine’s Day.

That’s why I don’t think Chocolat Fes needs to get involved in those adults’ agenda.

(Location: Staff dining hall)

**Hiyori**: (…… Woah. Jun-kun raised an unexpected objection.)

**Nagisa**: (…… Such a thing, it’s an unexpected development isn’t it? This is the first time.)

**Hiyori**: (Let’s keep an eye on it. I’m curious as to how Ibara will react……)

**Ibara**: …… It’s exactly as I described. Their wishes aren’t something I can easily ignore.

**Jun**: I know that. I wouldn’t say anything either if you were enthusiastic about it.

Even with my lacking brain, I understand the circumstances Ibara explained.

But in reality, even though you should have a leg in with “those guys” you’re complaining like this, aren’t you?

Ibara has so much passion for Chocolat Fes…

Even if you extend your hand out through COMP to impress the upper management, you’ll be the one who bears the brunt of those greedy people, you know.

**Ibara**: …… Things like that are my role as deputy director.

**Jun**: As Ohiisan said, COMP was already finished when we completed shooting the promotional video.

I don’t know much about plans and schedules…… But I’m sure there’ll be more opportunities to spend the budget.

Wouldn’t it be nice if we could just send our love to all our fans on Valentine’s Day?

We’ll do our best for the sake of the feelings you poured into Chocolat Fes.

Then I’m sure Eden’s performance will be a good one. No, I’ll make it the best it can be.

If we make it the best performance possible, then I’m sure it’ll naturally have a good impact……

Um, that’s why……

**Ibara**: ………

**Jun**: The extra budget from COMP probably wasn’t there when you first started thinking about Chocolat Fes.

But because of it, it’ll have a positive impact on CosPro’s schools and the planning was left to Ibara.

Honestly, don’t you think it’s ridiculous?

**Ibara**: …… You’re out of line. Your remarks are being said for your own sake.

**Jun**: Just in case, I’ll check around.

Such a thing that can be done through the power of money…… No, it’s done through Ibara’s power……

I don’t know, I think it’s too good to be true……

**Jun and Ibara**: ………

**Nagisa**: (…… Jun surely has a lot to say. He’s working hard to come up with the words.)

**Hiyori**: (But he’s stumbling because he started talking before he could gather his thoughts.

He doesn’t want to say anything ill of Ibara, it’s frustrating to listen to……)

**Nagisa**: (…… That part too, Ibara must have been able to understand it. Compared to his usual tone, his words seem much more frustrated.)

**Jun**: …… I know there are circumstances and compromises I don’t understand.

But I listened to Ibara. There’s still some frustrating parts, but I trust Ibara’s way of doing things, and I thought it was good……

Only this time, a horizontal spear called COMP was inserted into things.

If it’s difficult it’s only going to give you a headache. I’m saying let’s compete with only your plan and our abilities.

And…… Valentine’s Day is an event filled with love and kindness.

That’s why I think there’s no need for speculation here.

**Ibara**: Filled with love……?

(For me, Valentine’s Day is a sales season— a competition. It’s a fierce battle where businesses clash with each other.

The phrase “an event filled with love and kindness” has no place there.

Even though I’ve been saying things like benevolence, fraternity, and so on a lot lately… Emotionally, it’s hard to understand—and then they throw it at me.)

…… How irritating.

**Jun**: Huh? Just now, what’d you say?

**Ibara**: I don’t know what kind of Valentine’s Day is “filled with love.”

It’s quicker and easier to spend the money wisely and make a good impression for ES and the upper management in the process than to understand such things.

**Jun**: But……!

**Ibara**: …… However, I’ve received your opinion. If I can’t even convince Jun then it’s an issue.

I don’t think it’ll help things if we keep exchanging words here— so, I’d like to ask for some space.

I will contact you later on. …… Excuse me.

# The Depression of Youth

## 1

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/yur83hx9.png">

(Location: Training room)

**Ibara**: (…… It’s relaxing to only have to think about moving my body.

Muscles put under stress will grow stronger. Glycogen and Glucose are used up and sweat starts flowing. The body can function on its own.)

…… But that’s all for today. Excessive training will only generate fatigue.

— Fuu……

(I hadn’t expected to be opposed by Jun like that…… I should review the situation now that it’s calmed down somewhat.)

First, we decided both Adam and Eve would hold performances without objection.

Honestly, there’s a part of me that isn’t enthusiastic about COMP being involved like Jun had said.

That’s why…… I couldn’t help but feel that if I could, I would have too, and I reacted like that.

(…… And then, after taking on an attitude as if I had been accused, I left.)

………

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/p2ubo7hg.png">

**Ibara**: …… Ah, shit. What the hell am I doing?

(There have been countless times in the past that I’ve had to suck it up and deal with the agendas of those adults.

Maybe since I spent so long preparing for it, I became more attached to the project itself?

I’m so frustrated, and I’ve been thinking about it so much—

I should be ashamed of myself.)

…… Should I go back to the office and reconsider things?

(Something that is sincerely convincing, something that can convince him—)

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/z0go1cut.png">

(Location: CosPro offices)

**Ibara**: (……? The staff should have left the office by now. So why is someone sitting in a chair over there?)

Do you need something from Cosmic Productions?

**Hinata**: Ah, Vice Prez! Thank you for your hard work☆ (Salute)

I knew you’d still be at the ES building!

**Ibara**: Hinata-kun–

**Hinata**: Sorry for being here late! But I wanted to talk to you…… I have something to discuss with you!

**Ibara**: I don’t mind being consulted. However, wouldn’t it be better to visit the office tomorrow instead of at this late hour?

It’s not like I’m only free at night. If you contact me beforehand, I’ll make sure to set aside time for you.

**Hinata**: Ahaha…… Sorry, but I was in a bit of a hurry.

**Ibara**: …… Then let’s hear what you have to say.

**Hinata**: Thank you very much! Actually, it has to do with Chocolat Fes……

2wink will appear at both Yumenosaki and ES’s Chocolat Feses, right?

Right now I’m arguing with Yuuta-kun about the content…… just kidding. Actually, we were having a lively chat about it.

We exchanged opinions and it seems like Yuuta wants a pretty set with flashy production quality.

**Ibara**: Hm? That’s an unusual concept for 2wink.

**Hinata**: Of course, we’re a performance-focused unit who honed our skills by doing street performances in the middle of nowhere!

…… But… There’s not much time to let go of that idea, and I want to fulfill Yuuta-kun’s wish.

So that’s why I’ll continue working hard for CosPro, and I wondered if I could ask for some help in that regard.
image

**Ibara**: I see. So it’s not the content but the finances that’s making Yuuta-kun’s wish difficult to realize?

**Hinata**: Yeah…… Even if we used the same set for both Chocolat Feses it’d still cost money to transport it.

Ah– of course since the set’ll be reused there’ll be a difference in content! Showing the same thing twice isn’t really artistic.

**Ibara**: Fufu, that’s the least I could do.

But when it comes to the budget……

**Hinata**: In the end, it’s still difficult, huh.

**Ibara**: —No. I was simply just lost for a moment on whether my budget came from my own pocket or someone else’s.

**Hinata**: ?

**Ibara**: It’s nothing to worry about, I’ll cooperate. I’ll invest in 2wink.

**Hinata**: Eh, really?!

**Ibara**: 2wink is the only unit that belongs to Yumenosaki, so it must have felt unreasonable to have so few members on CosPro’s team during the Traditional Sports Festival.

And even regardless of that, you both work hard.

**Hinata**: Eh, eeeeh!? It’s so confusing being given compliments even when I came up with a bad idea……!

**Ibara**: There’s no need to be upset. We’ve concluded this negotiation so it’s fine to be happy about it.

**Hinata**: Gotcha, thank you!

**Ibara**: Create a stage that isn’t embarrassing for the CosPro group, liven up Chocolat Fes, and take charge of PR for the office. That is your condition.

**Hinata**: No problem! I’ll do my best……!

Ah\~ that’s good, what a relief\~! I’ll have to tell Yuuta-kun tomorrow……♪

## 2

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/tm2eztbf.png">

(Location: CosPro offices)

**Ibara**: …… As a side note, what kind of stage plan do you have for 2wink?

You said you were discussing yet but had yet to finalize it. If necessary, I’d be happy to consult with you on it.

**Hinata**: Ah\~…… Umm. I’m having a hard time there, but I can’t afford to become too dependent on Vice Prez.

We’ll sort it out and find a solution together.

**Ibara**: …… From what you said earlier, I could only discern Yuuta-kun’s opinion. You also have an opinion don’t you, Hinata-kun?

**Hinata**: Yeah, I also had a proposal. It didn’t go well with Yuuta-kun though, sadly……

But for the sweets we’re preparing ourselves, I figured that my opinion would be more useful since I actually like sweets.

Yuuta-kun probably wouldn’t be able to eat the chocolate ES prepared for Chocolat Fes.

I have to think of a PR method so I can taste it and the fans will buy it.

**Ibara**: …… Is that so? You seem to have your own ideas so I’ll refrain from interfering further.

**Hinata**: You weren’t being…… I really appreciate your suggestion.

But you’re also performing at Chocolat Fes aren’t you, Vice Prez?

**Ibara**: ? But of course.

**Hinata**: So Vice Prez is also an idol who conveys his love and feelings to everyone on Valentine’s Day♪

With such an idol and deputy director at CosPro, who’ll move money around like this for us……

You’re also doing a big job by producing Eden for this event. I can’t cause you any more trouble.

**Ibara**: — Understood. I’m not so soft as to need to be worried about, but I’ll accept your feelings.

**Hinata**: I’m sorry for coming here at such a late hour.

Is Vice Prez still working?

**Ibara**: …… I’m thinking of brushing up on the Chocolat Fes project right now.

**Hinata**: Hyah\~. I think I disturbed you when you were already having a rough time……

Well, excuse me. Please do your best, Vice Prez!

**Ibara**: Of course, take care on your way home.

**Hinata**: Also, thank you so so much! I’m looking forward to Eden’s performance\~♪

**Ibara**: ………

…… With the stage plan, I can’t help but think something was overlooked.

They shouldn’t be spending a frivolous amount of money or spending it carelessly…… It should be fine.

However, being an idol who conveys his love and feelings……

It’s slightly troublesome since it’s all about “love.”

……… (Faces his PC)

(Idol, deputy director, manager, producer…… No matter what position I’m in, I’m still me.

And no matter my position, I must be the victor of this Valentine’s Day Chocolat Fes.

Creating the perfect stage, displaying Eden’s authority, achieving absolute success, winning the sales battle……

I don’t know how many objectives I’ll pursue, but this is what I’ve always done.

I haven’t lived a life where I can walk without the confidence and determination to pursue two or three rabbits.

That’s why I don’t really care for working on COMP any more.)

…… Tch. The more I look at the plan, the more miserable it looks, and the more disgusted I feel.

Certainly, the management of the idol schools affiliated with CosPro are not irrelevant.

COMP is a project that CosPro came up with for the sake of CosPro.

But even so… It would be fine to be swayed around aimlessly by His Excellency and His Highness, but to have my plans twisted by upper management’s expectations makes me uncomfortable.

Didn’t I fulfill my obligation to some extent with the live shoot the other day?

It’s not a loss to restore our image or to get approval from above but……

Prioritizing it over the goal I’m trying to accomplish now… Isn’t it just getting in the way?

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/29kxs42n.png">

**Jun**: *But I listened to Ibara. There’s still some frustrating parts, but I trust Ibara’s way of doing things, and I thought it was good……*

*Only this time, a horizontal spear called COMP was inserted into things.*

*If it’s difficult it’s only going to give you a headache. I’m saying let’s compete with only your plan and our abilities.*

**Ibara**: …… Even without being told. I really knew that since the beginning.

………

(There was SS, and then I was sent COMP. I may have been out of my right mind somewhere along the way.

No, the person who upset me the most was Jun…… But thanks to him I was able to cool my head.

I’m still a long way from being recognized by Jun.)

— Don’t think that everything is easy to obtain. You don’t have to go grabbing everything you can get.

Let’s show that I’m only getting what I truly want!

(In that case, the involvement of COMP is unnecessary after all. Fufu, it feels good to eliminate unnecessary things……♪

Once I get rid of this, I’ll have more time to spare. In other words, I can power up the plan I have in store for Eden……!)

Therefore, as soon as possible—

…… Hm. A new plan has already been put together, my planning ability is outstanding……♪

The sooner you contact him, the better. I’m aware it’s late, but I should call him as soon as possible—

Hello? My apologies for the late call but I have a little question for you……

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/fupc1fuf.png">

(Location: ES hallway)

**Hinata**: Uwah……

(I came back to give him something as thanks for the advice, but the Vice Prez’s energy changed so drastically~!

I wondered if he was having difficulty, but he smiled and got back to work. I’ll avoid bothering him and just go straight home.

For Chocolat Fes, I’ll do the best that I– no, we– can do……!)

# Compassion and Warmth

## 1

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/itnly3jg.png">

(Location: Cafe COCHI)

(A few days later)

**Jun**: …… Haah…

**Hiyori**: Another sigh? How many times a day do you have to sigh, Jun-kun?

The more you sigh, the more happiness will escape you! Well, as long as I’m here, I’m sure the happiness will want to stay here♪

**Jun**: What kind of argument is that…

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/3hqy8g66.png">

**Jun**: …… Ah, happiness escapes when you sigh, huh?

Well, wouldn’t happy people be happier if they were near you than me, since I’m so gloomy?

**Hiyori**: Happy people…… What are you thinking about with the happiness of others?

Well after this we’ll have to go back to working as Eve, so we need to be more lively!

**Jun**: …… Sorry. I’ll make sure I’m feeling better at work and do my best.

**Hiyori**: Jun-kun’s been like that lately, so I know you’ll be able to lift your mood for work.

I want you to stop being depressed Jun-kun every time we’re in between work. Don’t you get tired just thinking about it?

**Jun**: It’s unreasonable to say don’t think about it\~……

Haah…… I shouldn’t have said anything brash towards Ibara, should I?

**Hiyori**: Hm well… I don’t know how many times I’ve heard you say that!

You said something brash or something. And you said some big things and so on.

You can’t take back what you’ve said, so you have no choice but to take responsibility for it, right?

**Jun**: That’s right……

**Hiyori**: Good grief… Jun-kun and Ibara have never disagreed with each other like they are now.

It was interesting so I planned to just enjoy watching things play out. But I’m getting tired of hesitant Jun-kun.

…… You said what you honestly thought, Jun-kun. It’s not a bad thing to be able to express your feelings.

And besides, I’m sure that was something only Jun-kun could say, and it must have been something on Ibara’s mind too.

**Jun**: …… Right. If it wasn’t, I don’t think Ibara would have left like that.

…… But, it’s not like I made him mad or anything. What’s with his attitude then?

**Hiyori**: Who knows? I don’t know how Ibara feels.

Currently, there are many separate jobs for Adam and Eve, but there are also jobs for Eden.

I mean, we all live in the same dormitory so you could ask him directly.

**Jun**: No…… Because, even if we work together it’s hard to make eye contact.

Despite everything, work is going at its usual pace and order, so I wonder if I’m the only one dragging it down?

Ah damn it! What the hell am I supposed to do!

**Hiyori**: Now there Jun-kun, don’t use foul language.

It’s interesting that it’s not Ibara, but rather Jun-kun with a foul mood, who’s saying that♪

**Jun**: Please don’t be entertained\~

…… Because, from the beginning, if we had opinions or complaints we always voiced them out loud to Ibara, right?

Ibara also listened to our opinions, and until now we were able to come to agreements about it, right?

Even though Ohiisan is selfish, he still considers it every time and comes to a compromise……

**Hiyori**: Hm? Just now, did I hear something I can’t ignore?

**Jun**: (No you didn’t, ignore it.) That guy, he does some pretty amazing things.

When we shot the MV before, thanks to Ibara’s help I was able to do the shoot with confidence……

**Hiyori**: I was the only one left out of the loop at that time.

**Jun**: How many times have I apologized? I’m sorry for not talking to you about it.

**Hiyori**: Yes. That’s why I won’t complain any more, and this time I’ll intervene in your problems just a little bit so I won’t be left out of the loop.

**Jun**: I don’t think you’d be left out of the loop since you were there when it happened……?

**Hiyori**: It’s a matter of feeling!

Since that time, Ibara is still Ibara…… He seems to be on the move again so Jun-kun must also move forward.

**Jun**: ?

**Hiyori**: At Chocolat Fes…… Ibara wants to fulfill a long-held wish that’ll benefit us in Eden.

That’s why Nagisa-kun and I didn’t object to Ibara’s plan. But, Jun-kun was the one to complain.

**Jun**: ………

**Hiyori**: I’ve been trying to figure it out, why did you say what you did?

**Jun**: …… Ibara didn’t seem satisfied with having COMP involved. He seemed irritated for some reason.

I didn’t want to get in the way of something Ibara was passionate about but…… I didn’t like it.

That’s why I said I was against it without thinking, and wound up saying a lot of brash things.

And in the end I was told that I was annoying.

**Hiyori**: …… Well, Jun-kun’s a “warrior of love.” You saw Ibara’s conflict and couldn’t leave it alone. 

**Jun**: What do you mean “warrior of love?”

**Hiyori**: …… Fufu♪

What Jun-kun just said, I felt it.

Personally, I think the reason you were able to give your opinion was that there’s a fundamental difference in the way you two see Valentine’s Day.

**Jun**: Differences in the way we see Valentine’s Day……?

**Hiyori**: Yes. At that time, Jun-kun said “Valentine’s Day is an event filled with love.”

Like Ibara, I don’t think Valentine’s is a time to fight. See, you two have different ways of thinking, right?

**Jun**: I guess……?

**Hiyori**: Since you’ve been saying stuff like that, you have an ideal for Valentine’s Day don’t you, Jun-kun?

I want to hear it. What do you think a normal Valentine’s Day is like?

## 2

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/xmdf7i9h.png">

(Location: Cafe COCHI)

**Jun**: Then, um……

**Hiyori**: Or rather, since then I’ve been thinking about it.

I don’t think I’ve ever experienced a normal Valentine’s Day.

Looking back, I just thought it was a time when I would get a lot of chocolate.

Now that I’m thinking about it, was that perhaps chocolate that had been prepared for Valentine’s Day?

**Jun**: No no, you can’t just say “perhaps” about something like that!

The thing is, you received but never returned the favor……

…… No, I’m afraid to ask about that. I’m sure Ohiisan’ll just respond with something on the spot.

(Changing the subject) Wh-what about Nagi-senpai?

**Hiyori**: Although Nagisa-kun likes chocolate, he probably doesn’t know as much about Valentine’s Day as I do, does he?

I’ve never heard anything about Valentine’s Day from Nagisa-kun……

But what should I do if he gets a lot of chocolate without my knowledge……!

**Jun**: How should I know? Well, since he has Ibara now he’s probably gonna get told “You’re out of free calories!” and get it confiscated from him.

**Hiyori**: How terrible! Nagisa-kun should hand it to me!

**Jun**: Do you want him to have it or not?

**Hiyori**: …… So, back to the topic at hand. What does Jun-kun think of as a normal Valentine’s Day?

**Jun**: Normally, well……

I get fidgety when Valentine’s gets close, and I’m nervous about getting chocolate.

I’d be happy if I got some on that day, but then I’d be worrying about what to get in return for White Day…… That kind of thing.

**Hiyori**: Oh ho♪

**Jun**: From the girls’ point of view I’m sure it’s different.

They’re thinking of the other person. What kind of chocolate should it be, how to prepare it, what to wrap it in……

They get worried about various things and it gets their heart beating I think.

**Hiyori**: Oh? Oh ho, heeh~?

(I didn’t think Jun-kun would have such sweet and sour memories.

Fufu. For some reason, I even felt a tightness in my chest……♪)

**Jun**: —It’s usually like that, in the manga I read at least.

**Hiyori**: …… Hm?

**Jun**: Lately, I’ve been trying to get into Shoujo manga too.

Hey, maybe one day there’ll be a job to do a live-action adaptation of such heart-wrenching works.

**Hiyori**: …… Hmm?

**Jun**: Oh here it is. This manga’s a pretty hot topic right now.

Volume 3 has a Valentine’s Day chapter…… Yet another development that’ll tug at your heartstrings~♪

**Hiyori**: W-Wait a minute! Why are you proudly showing me your phone screen?!

What you’ve got there is…… an e-book, right?

**Jun**: Yeah. With this I won’t clutter up my dorm so much since I can read without buying the physical thing♪

**Hiyori**: Then, what you said just now weren’t your thoughts on Valentine’s Day……

**Jun**: Nope. I don’t think I have any kind of sweet or sour memories of it.

**Hiyori**: Why……

The fact that it’s purely influenced by manga is very typical of you.

It’s a pity that my innocent heart, which was so moved by the thought of Jun-kun having such memories, was led astray.

**Jun**: I’m not responsible for the fantasies you came up with.

**Hiyori**: …… Yeah~. But it means Jun-kun doesn’t have any normal Valentine’s Day experiences after all.

What about the all important Ibara?

**Jun**: Well…… That guy probably doesn’t know what a normal Valentine’s Day is, right?

He said Valentine’s was a big sales season and then got oddly silent when I objected……

**Hiyori**: …… Ibara is also carrying all kinds of burdens too, isn’t he? I do recall him referring to his past as his gray youth.

**Jun**: …… So basically, none of us know what a  normal Valentine’s Day is like?

**Hiyori**: It seems that way. And since we’re performing in Chocolat Fes, this is a big deal!

“I’m…… late giving this to you. Your Valentine’s chocolate.”

“Th-Thank you…… I didn’t think I’d get one, so this makes me happy……”

**Jun**: …… What are you doing putting on a small play as one person with two roles.

**Hiyori**: I’m just reading off the manga page Jun-kun showed me. Hmm, so this is a normal Valentine’s Day……

**Jun**: In the manga, but…

**Hiyori**: But you got your image of a normal Valentine’s Day from manga, didn’t you?

That’s right, to the extent that the word love gets said……

So, if you could just tell Ibara that Valentine’s Day isn’t only about sales……!

**Jun**: If he thinks it’s a day full of love then he’ll keep the adults’ agenda out of it—

…… Will he?

**Hiyori**: You won’t know if it’ll work until you try it♪

Additionally, isn’t it necessary for us to experience a normal Valentine’s Day in the meantime?

Since no one here knows what one’s like?

**Jun**: Experience… Experience…… Yep.

In terms of experiencing Valentine’s Day, wouldn’t it be good to try and make chocolate~?

What kind of chocolate should I make to make it seem Valentine’s Days-y… For now I should just do a quick search……

**Hiyori**: Fufu. Then until we have to get back to work let’s study up on Valentine’s Day.

I’ll read from the manga Jun-kun was looking at……♪

(Location: Starmony Dorms Common Room)

**Ibara**: ………

**Nagisa**: …… Ibara.

**Ibara**: ………

**Nagisa**: …… Hey, Ibara.

**Ibara**: …… Yes, whatever is the matter, Your Excellency! I’m busy at the moment so please be brief!

**Nagisa**: …… It looks like you’ve been working in your uniform since you came back. Don’t you have to change clothes?

**Ibara**: My apologies! I simply didn’t have the time to change clothes!

I’ll change into my costume when I go on site later anyway, so I’ll just say I went straight from the Academy to the site!

**Nagisa**: …… I see. You’re not worried about wrinkles.

**Ibara**: …… So sudden. I have something I want to check before heading to the site, so please excuse me, Your Excellency.

Umm, the phone number of that client is—

**Nagisa**: ………

**Ibara**: Hello. This is Ibara Saegusa from Cosmic Productions calling……

Yes, thank you for your assistance. I’m calling you about the discussion we had the other day, may I have a minute of your time?

**Nagisa**: (…… Lately, Ibara’s been busy like this. Even when I try to talk to him, I just get the same “I’m busy!” response.

…… I can only imagine how busy he is based on what I can see from his PC screen and the amount of missed calls he has.

…… I don’t want to force someone as hardworking as Ibara to talk to me.

…… Huh? There’s a box on the table. I wonder if it’s okay for me to open…)

**Ibara**: —Of course, thank you so very much for your time♪

Thank you for your continued support! Now then, please excuse me.
image

**Nagisa**: …… Ibara.

**Ibara**: Your Excellency, I apologize but as I said earlier I’m busy……

**Nagisa**: …… I know, but look here.

**Ibara**: Huh?

— MMPH!?

**Nagisa**: …… There was a box of chocolates on top of the table, Ibara brought it, right?

**Ibara**: Nng. Mmfph…… Apologies.

What do you think you’re doing?! I almost swallowed a whole piece of chocolate!?

**Nagisa**: …… I was asking if you brought these.

**Ibara**: Tch. In the face of His Excellency’s doubts I’m powerless to complain……!

Yes, that is the case. I brought these here…… Or rather, this is the chocolate sample that was sent to me.

**Nagisa**: …… I tried one as well, the chocolate was delicious.

…… As a side note. I should say the reason I gave you chocolate was to replenish your sugar intake since you’ve been working all day.

**Ibara**: You don’t have to answer if the reason was such an afterthought—

No, I hadn’t expected you to think of myself and take action. Thank you for your concern, Your Excellency!

**Nagisa**: …… Ibara’s so busy that your mask and true intentions are blurring together.

**Ibara**: That is correct. I’m very busy at the moment!

…… I’ve lost focus, so I’ll take a break for a bit.

**Nagisa**: …… Good, it’s important to take breaks♪

**Ibara**: Hm? Are you still eating the chocolate?

**Nagisa**: …… Because it’s delicious. Am I not supposed to?

**Ibara**: No, if it’s just the one box feel free to do so. There are several other flavors as well.

However, if you get into a second box then your calorie calculations will be out of order so please ask me first!

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu. That means I can eat the entire box.

…… I’m happy to be able to enjoy the various flavors.

**Ibara**: Hm, you seem to be enjoying them. If His Excellency is praising it then that means the taste gets a passing score♪

**Nagisa**: …… By the way, earlier you mentioned something about a sample. Does this mean this chocolate is related to chocolate we’ll sell during Chocolat Fes?

**Ibara**: Indeed. This is a product that I’ve been involved in preparing for Eden since the planning stages of Chocolat Fes……☆
image

**Nagisa**: …… They look beautiful, like jewels.

**Ibara**: Fufun, that’s right♪ Although it’s still a prototype at the moment, I’m keen on the idea of the chocolate being designed to be as beautiful as a jewel.

This is because we work without making compromises no matter the process. Please look forward to the final product, Your excellency♪

**Nagisa**: …… If Ibara says so, then I’ll be looking forward to it. Eden’s chocolates are made with care, aren’t they?

**Ibara**: Of course. We want the customers to buy our original products, not the ones prepared by ES.

Even if the motive was just to support Eden, it’d be meaningless in the end if the appearance and taste were disappointing.

Having feelings of satisfaction towards their purchase may lead them to feeling good about being a fan of Eden.

Additionally, there may be customers who are interested in buying the product simply because it’s original.

Or they may have liked the design of the box and bought it based on that……

In this way, we can increase the number of people who buy our products even if they aren’t interested in Eden.

If our product is unable to satisfy those people alongside our fans, then having planned and developed these ourselves would have been meaningless.

Therefore, in addition to taste and appearance, we’ll also put a lot of effort into promoting it.

**Nagisa**: (…… Ibara is talkative……)

**Ibara**: First of all, it starts with expressing ourselves as Eden by having four pieces fit in one box……

This time, Adam and Eve will have separate stages, but the stage decorations will be linked—

(Location: Starmony dorm common room)

(After a while)

**Ibara**: —And, long story short, for this Chocolat Fes, the stage, composition, music, chocolate, etc…

No matter which one I put my heart and soul into, it’ll be something I’m proud of…… No, it’s become a part of me♪

**Nagisa**: …… Yes. Ibara’s explained a lot to me, so I understand it now.

**Ibara**: What’s with that smiling face? Was I talking that passionately?

**Nagisa**: …… You were. I’m still not very familiar with the intricacies of emotions, but I could feel your passion.

**Ibara**: ………

**Nagisa**: …… Recently, you’ve been working in your uniform like today.

…… When I thought you’d be making dinner, you’d go back to the office straight away.

…… You seemed very busy, so I wasn’t paying too much attention to you.

…… But if this is the case then my worries were unfounded.

**Ibara**: Your Excellency, did you have any concerns?

**Nagisa**: ……You and Jun had conflicting opinions, right?

**Ibara**: Ahh……

**Nagisa**: …… Back then, it seemed like Jun’s words resonated a lot with you.

…… But after that, during shoots and lessons when you two would normally interact…… You two never made eye contact.

**Ibara**: There aren’t many situations where eye contact is necessary, you know.

Well, there were times where we did almost make eye contact. But he was always the one to look away before we could, I don’t really care regardless.

**Nagisa**: …… Is that so? Then I wonder if it’s Jun who’s still caught up in his emotions.

…… Did something change with you?

**Ibara**: Change… Even if you say it’s change, I haven’t changed at all. I’m still pushing forward for Chocolat Fes.

— However, it did give me an opportunity to reflect on myself.

**Nagisa**: …… An opportunity?

**Ibara**: Why didn’t I like what Jun said? Why was I angry?

I had time to unpack my anger, trying to figure out why I was so irritated.

**Nagisa**: …… I see, and the result?

**Ibara**: …… When His Excellency and His Highness accepted the proposal, I lost my composure.

I’ve endured the adults’ agendas countless times, so I thought it would be fine to go along with everything as it happened.

However, Jun brought up the word “against” as a finality. On top of that, the concept of “love” was brought in and I couldn’t help but be annoyed.

…… It’s an embarrassing story. In the end, I unconsciously underestimated Jun thinking he wouldn’t say anything.

In a way…… I was stabbed by Jun’s “love” and woke up. I was able to remain calm.

So rather than saying I changed it should be that I woke up.

After all, it feels amazing to have things go my way! My plans are always in my control……♪

**Nagisa**: …… It must be pleasant to be the ruler on the playing field. Be greedy, but don’t get too carried away.

**Ibara**: Of course not. Your Excellency does this from time to time to make me vulnerable. Only this time, this Saegusa Ibara will never expose you to any blunders like that.

—Pardon, I have a call. I’ll answer it quickly……♪

**Nagisa**: (…… It’s been a while since I’ve seen Ibara work so vigorously.)

…… You’re enjoying your work now.

**Ibara**: ………

It’s nonsense to go through work without enjoying it. I’m happy to be able to move forward and achieve my ideals.

If the things currently in progress go well, then Eden’s Chocolat Fes performance will be the best……

If I think that my brain, heart, and limbs are all working towards that…… Then it doesn’t feel that bad♪

**Nagisa**: (…… We can make it in time for Chocolat Fes even if we don’t rush to solve the conflict between those two.

…… So Hiyori-kun and I decided to keep an eye on them for a bit.)

…… It seems victory is already in sight for Ibara, so I’ll do my best in the role I’ve been given.

**Ibara**: Oh, that’s right.

Apologies. As for future plans, if the things currently being discussed get finalized then there may be some small changes to the schedule.

I’m sorry to say I have a lot of other work to attend to and need to attend a photo shoot.

**Nagisa**: …… That’s fine. I’ll follow your instructions.

**Ibara**: Thank you very much! Assuming that the adjusted schedule is provisional, first—

**Nagisa**: (…… He’s right back to work. There’s no stopping Ibara’s hands.

…… Ibara’s doing much better than I thought. Or rather, compared to what I heard from Hiyori-kun about Jun’s situation—

…… No, I’m sure the two of them will be able to solve their issues.

…… I wish I could tell Jun about what I’ve just heard. But this is not my story to tell.)

…… With the chocolate… I can eat as much as one box, right?

……… (Takes a chocolate)

(…… I’ll continue to act as I have so that this Chocolat Fes can be a precious experience for Ibara.

…… Because Ibara’s experience of victory and success will also serve as sustenance for Eden in the future.)

…… Ibara.

**Ibara**: Yes! I’m still busy so please be brief!

**Nagisa**: …… I’m rooting for you, so do your best.

**Ibara**: ? Huh, thank you……?

**Nagisa**: ………♪

# Resulting Love

(Location: Outside Ensemble Square)

(Later, early morning)

**Jun**: (I don’t have any work this morning. But I don’t really know when the work tonight will end.

…… Ibara’s working this afternoon, but he’s already left the Starmony dorms. I confirmed it with Aoba-senpai so there’s no doubt..

In that case, even if no other staff is working at the moment, he’s probably at the office……

In other words, this morning is the only opportunity to talk to Ibara properly!

There’s still a lot of work split between Adam and Eve……

Even when Eden meets together, we never really had any time to talk~

…… I feel like we’re beginning to meet each other’s eyes, but he’s still in the middle of work. He can’t even talk slowly can he?)

…… That’s why today—no, right now—is the time to talk to Ibara!

I can’t drag this confusion on forever!

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/07nu6vvl.png">

(Location: CosPro offices)

**Jun**: Pardon me~

…… Hmm? That’s weird~ The lights are on but nobody’s around.

Heeeey, Ibara?

…………

No, how did he not even reply? Could he be in the conference area?

—I’ve looked around and there’s no sign of him. Then why are the lights on?

I don’t think he’d forget to turn off the light…… Did he leave his seat for a bit then?

No matter how strong ES’s security is, it’d be pretty unsafe to just leave his stuff unattended.

(…… Ah. At the foot of Ibara’s desk, there’s shoes.

Wh- so he’s at work after all! If I wait here a little longer, surely Ibara will come back—)

…… Also… There’s papers on the desk.

The plans for Chocolat Fes include drawings of the live stage. Are the lyrics for the new song in the file……

This time, both Adam and Eve will get new songs. Both of them have a different “vibe” from Eden… I like it~……

I want to show it off on the Chocolat Fes stage as soon as possible♪

And is this…… the storyboard for the next filming that’s been entered~? Plus, with how clear everything is, it must have been drawn by Ibara.

What’s with this glittery illustration here…… Is it a design drawing or something?

I’ve seen it before, it’s related to Eden’s original chocolate. Heeh, what is this feeling……?

……… (Looks over the documents)

(How should I put it, Ibara is the type to write all over the paper…… There’s notes here and there.)

………

**Ibara**: ………?

(Who could that…… Could it be Jun this time?

I wonder if it’s the latest trend to ambush people in the office while I’m away.)

—What are you doing there?

**Jun**: Oh, it’s Ibara. Welcome back.

**Ibara**: I’m back…… However– that’s not the matter at hand. I asked what you were doing at my desk. 

Are you snooping? You also seem to have good ways to spend your time.

**Jun**: Snooping… With stuff spread out in the open like this I couldn’t help but take a look.

But I did flip through them one by one. Sorry for looking at it without permission.

I came to see you at the office but you weren’t there. Instead it looked like you were dealing with the materials……?

**Ibara**: Seriously. Even though I only left my seat for a short time, Jun has bad timing……

I just went to get a drink from the stand, so it’s fine.

You came to the office at this hour while I was away…… What would you have done if I was absent to begin with?

**Jun**: No. You’re the kind of guy who works even on New Year’s so I was pretty confident that you’d be working this morning.

So I didn’t really think about  what would happen if you weren’t there.

**Ibara**: ………

**Jun**: Why are you looking at me like “what the hell are you talking about?”

I came here because I had something I needed to do…… I told you earlier that I came to see you.

**Ibara**: Even though we had plenty of opportunities to do so during work, I got caught up in you going out of your way to say “I came to see you.”

What’s the big deal?

**Jun**: It’s not really…… I came to see you because I think we need to talk face-to-face.

—I want to apologize for the other day.

**Ibara**: The other day?

**Jun**: Looking at the documents spread out here…… I can tell by looking at Ibara’s detailed writing.

No, actually, when you were explaining Chocolat Fes I could feel your hard work and effort. 

And yet I…… Lashed out with an unorganized opinion……

I was against it, and I was worried about you. You must have been annoyed by someone saying stuff like that without knowing your situation.

So that’s why, I want to apologize—

**Ibara**: No thank you.

**Jun**: I thought…… Hm?

Just now, what did you say?

**Ibara**: No thank you, is what I said. There’s no need to apologize, it’s fine, you don’t have to.

**Jun**: What……?

**Ibara**: To avoid misunderstandings…… I’d like to say the apology itself was not annoying or anything of the sort.

It certainly made me angry at the time, but now I hardly care at all. So you don’t need to apologize to me, Jun.

**Jun**: ?

**Ibara**: By any chance, were you not told?

I don’t care about what you said, nor do I want to keep dragging it on. Additionally, the preparations for Chocolat Fes are going well.

Or rather, the events of that day were still lingering in Jun’s mind.

**Jun**: ???

**Ibara**: Fu, fufu……

I thought you were looking at me with a strangely restless look about you at the shoot. So that’s how it was.

**Jun**: Wh-wh-WHAT!?

## 2

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/yo36gqp3.png">

(Location: CosPro offices)

**Jun**: W-wait, wait, wait, wait……?

Could you wait a moment? I still don’t understand what you’re saying.

Ummm……? While I was in agony every day and even consulted Ohiisan about my worries, you were already over it? 

**Ibara**: Yes.

**Jun**: GODDAMN! Even with you saying “yes” I still don’t get it!

I’ve been worried about this for a long time! When did you resolve it, Ibara!?

**Ibara**: After Jun said that to me, I took some time to reflect upon myself…… Three days later, it was completely resolved.

**Jun**: Three days later!?

**Ibara**: Since a while ago, all your reactions have been unnecessarily exaggerated.

**Jun**: No, but– Eeeeeh……?

**Ibara**: —Jun’s words prompted me to reflect, calm down, and tweak my plans.

COMP has already been eliminated from my own plan…… Or rather, from the Chocolat Fes proposal.

As you wished, although I know it sounds like sarcasm to say that.

Just as Jun had said, I originally thought it was a nuisance.

Now that COMP is eliminated it can be said that my powered up plan is even better than my ideal. Would you like to see?

**Jun**: I-I can’t keep up!

Why didn’t you tell me sooner when I’ve been worrying about it all this time?!

**Ibara**: After deciding to eliminate COMP, I’ve been busy working on the new project that resulted……

It was difficult to set up a time and place where everyone could meet up and have things explained again.

I felt that lessons and work were proceeding smoothly without an explanation……

After that, His Excellency had an opportunity to ask me questions, so I wound up explaining it to him there.

**Jun**: Please be a little more embarrassed. I’ve been feeling awkward all this time.

Ohiisan and I were even working on a “Normal Valentine’s Day Experience Plan” in between work too……

**Ibara**: “Normal Valentine’s Day Experience Plan?” What is that?

**Jun**: Sorry but I’m not telling. We’ll get it in action once we’re further along, so just be patient and wait!

**Ibara**: It’s a confusing concept and I’d rather not wait……

**Jun**: Don’t worry, it’ll be something by us for us.

**Ibara**: Haah……

**Jun**: I’m the one who needs to sigh.

While I was confused, you quickly regrouped yourself and kept going with your plans for Eden and Chocolat Fes.

Aah, that’s right. All the documents on the desk are here because Ibara was working hard……

**Ibara**: —I can’t tell if you’re frustrated or depressed.

It’s annoying if the rope is wrapped around too tightly…… So let me explain.

**Jun**: ?

**Ibara**: …… At the time, I hadn’t assumed you would oppose me.

I had never dreamed that Jun would raise an objection.

Even if you had questions or complaints, I never thought that you would say “NO.”

**Jun**: …… I’m getting the feeling that I’m being underestimated again.

**Ibara**: Yes, I underestimated you quite a bit☆

**Jun**: Why you……!

**Ibara**: —However, if Jun had not objected then I would have smeared my own plan with the mud of COMP.

Even so, it’s part of my job to make it look good, so I buried my feelings of distaste towards it.

**Jun**: ………

**Ibara**: It’s thanks to Jun that I didn’t have to do that.

With this opportunity, I was able to refine my plans and projects related to Chocolat Fes.

Not just improved, but even further. There are also many new things I have achieved.

So that means…… When I feel frustrated, depressed, or helpless…

I can tell myself to not feel so sullen.

**Jun**: …… I was preparing to hear you say “thank you” but the words didn’t come out~.

**Ibara**: It’s not a pattern.

**Jun**: Understood.

…… Well, is that it? Was I able to help Ibara?

**Ibara**: No. You were of great help to not just myself but also to raising the overall quality of Eden’s presence at Chocolat Fes.

The reason I was able to work with such a renewed feeling was because of your opposition, Jun.

**Jun**: …… Haha♪ If you say it like that then I’ll feel even more fired up.

It was really frustrating to have to worry alone but……

I’m really relieved to know Ibara will bring us to the top with his own hands and plans♪

After all, that’s how Ibara does things. That’s how you produce us as Eden.

…… Even if sometimes things don’t go well♪

**Ibara**: Hmph, that’s none of your business.

**Jun**: Ah, I’m feeling good now that the haze has finally cleared up.

Now I feel like I can do anything for Chocolat Fes……♪

**Ibara**: That’s reassuring. I was just about to inform you of the rearranged schedule once I was done here.

In the midst of increasing our exposure as Eden, we began filming advertisements for our merchandise.

In parallel with the lessons for Chocolat Fes, do your best to work hard……☆

**Jun**: Just leave it to me♪ No matter the work or schedule, I’ll be here to help!

…… By the way, do you know any restaurants that are open right now?

**Ibara**: ? I have a grasp of which one might be.

**Jun**: That works. Let’s go eat breakfast now♪

**Ibara**: What?

**Jun**: I said I would treat you to it when you helped me before, but we weren’t able to do it, so…

I’ll treat you to whatever you want to eat♪

**Ibara**: I’m at work. Don’t get carried away just because you’re feeling better.

**Jun**: Ahaha, you’re showing your true colors.

By the way, I’m fine with normal breakfast sets. What would you like to eat?

**Ibara**: The ones at the restaurants I know are fairly normal. But the contents vary based on the location.

**Jun**: Then let’s go to the place Ibara goes to the most. Yep, I’m starting to get hungry……♪

**Ibara**: (…… What does he mean “I’ll help you when you’re in trouble?” Honestly, I wasn’t in trouble at all.

Because of Jun’s help…… I’ll just say I was bailed out.)

## 3

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/517p8lvt.png">

(Location: Reception Room)

**Ibara**: —Alright, thank you everyone for taking time out of your busy schedules to meet here!

I apologize for my delay in setting up such a conference due to the difficulty in coordinating our schedules—

I would like to explain the revised plan for Chocolat Fes.

**Jun**: …… So, we should first look at the materials you gave us.

I’ve already looked over most of it before you brought it up.

**Nagisa**: …… Me too. This is a place for meetings but I think it’s also a place where we can all gather and talk calmly.

…… It would be a waste to spend that time just reading the materials

**Hiyori**: I also read it too.

I’ve been very busy lately, and every day has been so filled to the brim that it’s overwhelming.

After all, we have to prepare for the “Valentine’s Day Experience Plan.”

**Ibara**: …… I’ve heard about that quite a bit since the other day. What is this experience plan……?

**Hiyori**: (Ignoring him) So that’s why it’ll be nice if you could verbally say what you want, Ibara.

I’ll listen and point out any concerns I have and ask questions.

I hope there’ll be a bit of time to relax as usual.

It seems like—on that desk over there, you’ve got chocolates and drinks prepared……♪

**Ibara**: So you noticed.

**Jun**: Of course we’d notice. From the moment we entered the room they had a strong presence.

**Ibara**: I’d like…… to unveil this as soon as possible.

First, I’ll briefly go through a review on Chocolat Fes.

I hope your lessons are going well. This time, the performance will go in the order of Eve then Adam……

Then Eden is arranged to be the third part, making our turn at Chocolat Fes fulfilling.

The two of you in Eve will take on the role of drawing the audience’s attention to us.

**Jun**: That’s a big responsibility~. But in the end it’s even more rewarding♪

**Hiyori**: Those people will be unable to resist our charms.

We’ll tell them to come enter paradise with us……♪

**Ibara**: After that, we as Adam must make a strong impression to win people’s hearts and drag them into paradise.

**Nagisa**: …… Attention and interest, enticement and fixation.

…… And through that process we will entrap them in our paradise.

**Ibara**: I want to see more performances, I want to be with them more. With that connection to Eden, that kind of desire will be born inside them.

**Hiyori**: Fufu. After inviting them to paradise, all they have to do is spend time in the happy and sweet dream with us♪

**Jun**: The stage set is different between Adam and Eve, so it’s worth seeing both~

With our performance, it’s only natural that there’ll be a point where people will get hooked♪

**Nagisa**: …… Our influence and the memories we plant will surely spread across Chocolat Fes.

**Ibara**: Indeed. As our influence explands, our topicality increases, and the remaining memories lead to action.

And, to encourage those who are spectators to buy—

**Hiyori**: That’s where our chocolate comes in♪

**Ibara**: I believe I told you all before that we’re preparing our own original chocolate.

After brushing up on the plan, I reconsidered the design from scratch.

…… Valentine’s Day seems to be a day to deliver love.

By giving it the meaning of giving a form to our love for our fans, I think it’ll be a far more suitable product for Chocolat Fes.

**Hiyori**: Does this mean we can finally open the box? I couldn’t help but want to confirm the contents quickly.

**Jun**: Just by looking at it I can tell it’s a beautiful box. It looks like it’s a jewel—

**Hiyori**: Wa! Jun-kun, Jun-kun, you’re spoiling it! It’s exactly like you said it was!

**Jun**: …… It really is. There’s four jewel-like chocolates inside.

Also, I think I’ve seen this shape recently……?

## 4

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/psro1hn7.png">

(Location: Reception Room)

**Hiyori**: Ah, I’ve got it! It looks exactly like the stage we stand on during Chocolat Fes……!

**Jun**: Ah, that’s it!

Eh, if you look closely they really do look alike…… Are they matching?

**Ibara**: …… Do you think this happens if it’s not supposed to be matching?

**Hiyori**: Eh~. I thought it would be delicious, but looking at the four of them lined up like this makes me regret eating them.

**Nagisa**: …… In that case, why don’t we eat one piece per person rather than one box each?

**Hiyori**: As expected of Nagisa-kun, what a great idea! Then I’ll be taking this piece……♪

**Nagisa**: …… Is the taste the same as the one I tried last time?

**Ibara**: Yes, because it received Your Excellency’s approval I figured there would be no issues if the taste was kept the same.

**Jun**: Nagi-senpai, when did you try it? Ibara, you gotta tell us these things too.

**Ibara**: We had a lot of work to do separately……

**Hiyori**: That’s an excuse! You called me in the middle of the night……

**Jun**: The middle of the night?

**Hiyori**: Didn’t I tell you Ibara seemed to be on the move?

He made a rare request to have me introduce him to a jeweler acquainted with my family.

That’s why I introduced Ibara to a jewelry designer as well as a jewelry wholesaler……

So because those people are involved even the box looks like a jewelry box.

**Ibara**: …… It was a request made on short notice, so it was quite unreasonable of me.

Thanks to you, the container is worthy enough for the chocolate we’re offering……♪

**Jun**: Before we even knew it……

**Ibara**: It was quite difficult~. Using His Highness’s connections, using my own connections, as well as my own personal means, all while minimizing costs……

If they’re a fan of us and see our Chocolat Fes stage for even a moment……

It’s difficult to create a product that they will absolutely want to pick up.

**Nagisa**: …… You said it was difficult twice.

**Ibara**: It was tough, but I don’t think of it as hard work, if you understand what I mean. I don’t think of it as anything other than a challenge.

The chocolate itself was so good that I wanted to make a new visual to match the design……

Because I  also squeezed shoots into everyone’s schedule. I’m sure everyone else is also having a hard time.

**Jun**: Relying on Ohiisan’s connections and even expressing your own desires…

Ibara, you’re really serious about this~……

**Hiyori**: Yes. Even for Ibara it must have been difficult to prepare everything he has so far.

I wondered a little, would you be able to retrieve everything properly?

This time, it seems like you managed to avoid it once and for all. Didn’t you think about using COMP’s budget at all?

**Ibara**: —This time, I decided to make it my own project for Eden by my own hands.

There was meaning in doing my best, otherwise I wouldn’t have been able to convince myself. I thought I would have to convince everyone else this way as well.

**Jun**: ………

**Ibara**: The victory I have achieved is what one I wanted.

I wanted to bring Eden to the top by my own hands, I wanted to stand at the top…… I had my own stubbornness and drive. I’ve long since forgotten about that money.

Well, in the future I’ll make lots of use of that money! Ahaha☆

**Hiyori**: …… Hmm, what a pity. It was such a good story until the middle.

**Nagisa**: …… But, I know Ibara is a good boy.

**Jun**: …… I mean, for both Eden’s fans and us he’s done a lot all by himself.

And yet he says he’s “not struggling.”

Isn’t that what Ibara’s “love” is?

**Ibara**: …… Excuse me?

**Jun**: It’s not “excuse me?” it’s “love.” I think everything could not have been done without love.(1)

**Ibara**: ………

…… No, no, it’s not love.

**Nagisa**: …… Ibara seems to be a little shy. Is it a ○ or ×?

**Hiyori**: It must be ○! He’s looking away all embarrassed right now!

**Ibara**: Stop there! Don’t play around using me as a quiz!

**Jun**: Haha. If you get mad like that then they’ll just tease you even more, y’know~?

So, “love” is fine now, right?

This time, Ibara will win Valentine’s day. No matter what, it’s the day of love……♪ 

<br>

TL NOTES:
<ol>
<li>Jun makes a pun here in the original text. Ibara says “Hai?” which, of course, sounds like love (“ai”)</li>

(Chocolat Fes Final Stage, Eve’s Special Stage)

**Hiyori**: “……Ahaha, what incredible cheering♪”

“And there’s a bit of a commotion? It seems that everyone is surprised to see only the two of us appear on stage!”

“Did you think that just because it’s your long-awaited Eden’s appearance, that it’s a given that Eden’s stage would begin?”

**Jun**: “Well, that’s what you’d think, yeah\~?”

“To be honest, when I first heard about this, I got a little nervous too wondering what sort of reaction we’ll get.”

“But seeing the faces you’re all making…… I get that you’re excited to see what’s going to happen.”

**Hiyori**: “Mm. Everyone being excited and restless is cute♪”

**Jun**: “To live up to your expectations, from now on we will be showing you a passionate……”

**Hiyori**: “The beginning of Eden’s stage, from us Eve. I’d like you to not look away for even a moment.”

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/azkb07jx.png">

**Jun**: “Then let’s have you listen…… no, let’s have you savour it.”

“Well then, on this day called Valentine’s. Experience a burning-like love with us.”

Hiyori and **Jun**: “— Ruby Love”

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/yvkpojh0.png">

(Location: ES live stage backstage)

**Nagisa**: …… So it seems that our stage has begun.

**Ibara**: Yes. Judging from the sound of the cheering, it’s exalting to know that the fans’ reactions are also excellent♪

I’ve only just now researched it, but it seems that a rumour that only ‘Eve’ has appeared with a new song is spreading with intense momentum.

From this article, predictions about Adam will arise and we can see people’s expectations grow in real time.

Fufufu♪ There is nothing greater than witnessing the moment we blow their minds and pierce their hearts like this!

**Nagisa**: …… The chocolates have also become a topic of discussion. Our decorated photos also stand out quite a bit.

…… However, it might be too quick to be joyous.

**Ibara**: And that means?

**Nagisa**: …… We have yet to achieve either the victory, or the success, or the achievements that Ibara had mentioned.

…… We’ve done the preparations and expended our efforts according to Ibara’s strategy up until now. Though I think there are efforts on Ibara’s end that are unknown to us.

**Ibara**: …… Alright.

**Nagisa**: …… I believe what determines a victory that is not limited to just numbers lies within Ibara.

…… We pray that the things you have prepared up till today, as well as today’s event, will become something irreplaceable for you.

…… In response to Ibara’s love, I want Ibara to grasp the things you wanted with your own hands.

……. Which is why, when you have managed to grasp what you wanted with those hands, I’d like you to share that joy with us.

**Ibara**: —……As you command, Your Excellency.

(Location: Chocolat Fes stage (Eve))

**Hiyori**: “\~♪ \~♪”

(Hehe. You can see that everyone is observing each and every move we make.

That’s just how enamored they are with us. It feels really great!

But it’s still not enough. I want them to look at us, nail us with even more serious gazes-

Just keep on being entranced, okay……♪)

**Hiyori and Jun**: “♪\~ ♪\~ ♪”

**Jun**: (Even though I went and said something embarrassing like “Let’s experience a burning-like love♪”

This moment of accepting this feeling called being liked with all our body and giving it back with all our strength isn’t something you can replace after all\~)

“♪\~ ♪\~……”

(Valentine’s Day is a day filled with love after all.

With every song and every dance, it’s as if my whole body is gradually collecting love.

For the performance of a day like today’s, I’ll show you that I can reach the very end of this performance with the power of this love……!)

“Did our singing voices and performance reach you?”

“…… But we’re not going to give you time to linger in the reverberations. The next part will steal you away and bring you in deeper……♪”

“Ibara, Nagi-senpai! We’re counting on you for the next part~!”

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/bf3yobsu.png">

(Location: Chocolat Fes stage (Adam))

**Nagisa**: “…… Just as chocolate comes in a range from sweet to bitter varieties, there are many different flavours of emotions to taste.”

**Ibara**: “We Adam, will teach you this, using this song……☆”

Nagisa and **Ibara**: “— Melting Rouge Soul”

**Nagisa**: (…… With their hearts in delirium after seeing Eve’s sweet dream, they will get entangled in Adam, and may they fall into us.

…… Though this is a very typical Ibara-like strategy, I don’t hate it.

…… By conquering the hearts of the fans—No. What we are trying to do is to increase the number of people who love Eden.

…… I cherish everyone who loves Eden. I hope to convey this feeling into the very depths of everyone’s hearts.

……Ibara also seems to be singing with a pleasant feeling.)

“……\~♪”

**Ibara**: (? That wasn’t supposed to be the part where we were to miss each other’s gazes. However, it felt like His Excellency’s gaze was on me….?

—However, this is not the time to be lost in thought. This is still not the full extent of what our stage could be.)

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/9tp4v2q6.png">

**Ibara**: (……Into the depths of the hearts of all the people gathered here today, and to all the people we will meet from now on……

……We will engrave our power, our charm. Our very existence itself.

……We will lure you in before you even realise that you’re drowning in us. And then surely, we will steal your whole hearts away♪)

“♪\~♪\~!”

(In this ChocoFes— The one to reign supreme with the deepest of “love”, is us Eden!)

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/hqizyq72 .png">

(Location: Starmony Dorm Kitchen)

(A few days later.)

**Hiyori**: Look, look. Our chocolates are still going viral on social media.

They’re trying to find a way to preserve them just because they look so wonderful, even though the chocolates taste so good.

**Nagisa**: …… The fans do think up curious things. What’ll come of preserving them?

**Jun**: Maybe they just wanna keep them as a reminder\~?

I saw a blog post about someone writing their impressions of Chocolat Fes on the very same day.

Seems like that person had wanted to record everything they felt on that day in writing, so they wrote the blog post with all their heart.

**Hiyori**: That sounds like a sort of preservation too? It’s like everyone is carving their feelings for Chocolat Fes into their hearts and it makes me so happy♪

**Nagisa**: …… The atmosphere in the venue after Eden’s stage had ended was so impactful. How should I describe that atmosphere?

**Hiyori**: It was as if everyone had entrusted their hearts and bodies to us, like they were in a trance? Even though it was similar to our usual lives, it was a little different……

**Jun**: It was the kind of atmosphere that can only be felt during Chocolat Fes— So it was something that could only happen on Valentine’s day~

That’s definitely the best answer ♪. Don’t you think so too, Ibara—

**Ibara**: ………

**Hiyori**: What’s with that face? We’re talking about the Chocolat Fes that happened just as Ibara had envisioned. So, shouldn’t you be making a more cheerful expression?

Perhaps I should say; Ibara’s the one who should be talking about this, right?
image

**Ibara**: —Unlike the rest of you, I’m properly busy using my hands!

I mean, Your Highness was the first person to bring it up, weren’t you? Something or other about wanting everyone in Eden to have a normal Valentine’s day experience……

Why am I making homemade chocolates even though Valentine’s day is behind us?! I still can’t comprehend it!

**Nagisa**: …… Isn’t it because Hiyori-kun wanted everyone to have a normal Valentine’s day experience?

**Ibara**: Isn’t that exactly the same as what I’ve just said? I demand a proper explanation, Jun.

**Jun**: Eh, so you’re taking it out on me. Even though I’m standing right next to you and helping Ibara out seriously.

**Ibara**: That’s to be expected. Lately it seems that His Excellency has taken up an interest in cooking and gained some experience in it, but he doesn’t have much experience in making sweets. As for His Highness—

**Hiyori**: I’ll be casting a magic spell so that everyone’s chocolates will tu~rn out delicious……♪

**Ibara**: He’s that sort of person. It turned out this way because Jun never lets him help out.

I’ve been compiling as many detailed recipes as I can find so that I may entrust the work to His Excellency.

**Nagisa**: ……. I’ve already mastered mixing ingredients together until there are no lumps.

**Ibara**: As expected of Your Excellency! It really is so helpful that you are a fast learner! Now I would like you to combine what you’ve just mixed together!

The next step is to wrap the combined ingredients in a plastic wrap and leave them to chill in the refrigerator! Please work on putting these things together!

**Nagisa**: ……Mm, I got it♪

**Jun**: Wow. Unlike Nagi-senpai, who is interested in cooking, it seems like it’ll go much faster for me if I cook by myself.

I did think about at least letting him cut up some chocolate bars for me, but the thought of that person holding a knife is really scary……

**Hiyori**: ?

**Jun**: ……I mean, it’s not like there’s a lot of stuff to explain.

I didn’t even realise that Ibara got over that wall by himself. When I sucked it up and finally went to consult Ohii-san about it……

Neither Ohiisan nor I knew anything about what a normal Valentine’s day is supposed to be like. We realised then that Ibara and Nagi-senpai must be the same way.

Since we were going to make an appearance in Chocolate Fes, the conversation turned to how everyone in Eden not knowing what a normal Valentine’s day is supposed to be like is a problem……

That’s when the “Normal Valentine’s Day Experience Plan” plan started.
image

**Ibara**: …… If it was intended to be for Chocolat Fes, isn’t it strange that the plan is being executed after the event had already ended?

**Hiyori**: That’s because we were sooo busy with work for Chocolat Fes. We didn’t have any time.

So I’d like you to make extra portions of delicious chocolates to celebrate the success of Chocolat Fes too♪

**Ibara**: Haah……

**Hiyori**: By the way, when the chocolates are done, we’ve planned for us to participate in a simulation of giving and receiving chocolates.

That’s why everyone has to put in as much affection as possible while making them……♪

**Ibara**: Haa\~……?

**Jun**: Ah\~ sorry. That’s my fault too.

Since I only know about Valentine’s day from shojo manga, I made Ohiisan read the manga too.

Seems that he really wants to experience the feeling of wanting to give and receive chocolates and the fluttering feeling that comes with the experience.

**Ibara**: Do you really think that you’re going to get that fluttery feeling by doing an exchange between unit members?

**Jun**: Maybe you’ll at least feel a little warm and fluffy? Who knows?♪

**Ibara**: —Honestly, it feels like I’ve gotten myself into a troublesome plan. I’m still quite busy with Chocolat Fes-related work, you know?

Due to the overwhelmingly positive responses and reviews, I have received a variety of requests lately.

**Nagisa**: …… Then, that means that Ibara’s Chocolat Fes is still on-going.

**Hiyori**: In that case, won’t this “Valentine’s Day Experience Plan” fit perfectly? Even Eden’s Valentine’s is still on-going……♪

**Ibara**: This situation and that situation are not the same.

**Jun**: …… Yet even though you keep groaning about it, you’re still making the most elaborate designs out of all of us~

**Nagisa**: …… What are you making? Yours look the most delicious, so I’m curious as well.

**Ibara**: Mine don’t just look delicious, they’re actually the most delicious of the bunch. I’m even making them look as aesthetically pleasing as possible.

I have no intention of losing even when it comes to making sweets!

I hope you are all looking forward to it……☆

**Hiyori**: Since you’re saying that, I can’t wait to see the final product♪

**Nagisa**: …… Mm. I’m looking forward to eating it.

**Jun**: Ya know, there isn’t supposed to be any element of competition in this Experience Plan……

Ah well, I guess greedily aiming for the top in any situation is just an Ibara thing.

—All right. I’ll make my own chocolates pretty and enjoy Eden’s Valentine’s with the guys\~♪

# Mini Talks

## Ibara Saegusa - The Valentine's Day Warfront

### Episode 1

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/qc6t1poz.png">

(Location: CosPro Office)

**Ibara**: Now then, what kind of approach should I take?

Next year will certainly be a fierce battle. If I come up with a half-baked plan then I’ll be beaten by my competitors……

…… Oh, why isn’t it Anzu-san! My apologies for not noticing right away!

> Option 1: What are you doing?

**Ibara**: I’m planning to have a meeting with a manufacturer for next year’s Valentine’s Day.

I was just working on a sales plan and strategy just for that☆

> Option 2: Chocolate?

**Ibara**: Yes, I was looking into Valentine’s Day again……

…… Ah, right. If you don’t mind, could I take up some of your time? I would like to hear your opinion, Anzu-san♪

> Option 3: Can I help you with something?

**Ibara**: There’s no need! This is a personal job……

I was just thinking about strategies to win the Valentine’s Day sales.

### Episode 2

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/tln0uq4h.png">

(Location: CosPro Office)

**Ibara**: For confectioners, Valentine’s Day is a major sales battle that they must win.

For that reason, I gathered information about Valentine’s Day and worked out a sales plan that would resonate with customers……

Even if you can say “sales plan” in a single breath, there’s various strategies you can follow. Where should we focus our efforts……?

> Option 1: Distribution or something……

**Ibara**: Do you mean increasing the amount of stores carrying it so people can access it easier?

As expected of the talented Producer-dono, we had the same idea! Strengthening logistics is a simple but important thing……☆

> Option 2: Advertising on social media.

**Ibara**: So you repeatedly promote your product through social media, and customers will get the word out via word of mouth.

It might be a good idea to hold an event on social media to build up more excitement♪

> Option 3: Product novelty.

**Ibara**: Of course. If we have similar products to other confectioners then we can’t expect explosive traction.

By clarifying the concept and differentiating the product from other companies…… the product becomes more attractive☆

### Episode 3

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/nbf0m6yz.png">

(Location: CosPro Office)

**Ibara**: Thank you for your wisdom. Thanks to Anzu-san, I think I can come up with a great sales strategy.

As a business owner, I can’t afford to fall behind in the Valentine’s Day sales battle.

Together with idol activities, we will come out of this battle victorious……☆

> Option 1: You’re welcome.

**Ibara**: Did you learn something by talking to myself?

…… As usual, Anzu-san is an enthusiastic student, isn’t she? But it’d be great if you could help me☆

> Option 2: Please talk to me if you’re in trouble.

**Ibara**: No, no! I can’t take up Anzu-san’s time any more than I already have!

…… However, Anzu-san’s perspective is one I can’t replicate. So, if I need anything I’ll ask you♪

> Option 3: I’m looking forward to it.

**Ibara**: What kind of chocolate will it be, I wonder?

Fufu, it’s about time I can stay calm like this. This Saegusa Ibara, and Anzu-san as well, will produce amazing results……!

## Ibara Saegusa - New Year's Hard Worker

### Episode 1

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/vpwd395b.png">

(Location: ES Lobby)

**Ibara**: Why if it isn’t Anzu-san! It’s been a long time, it’s great to see you early in the new year!

Yes, happy new year☆ I wish you all the best this year as well.

Did I go to ES for…… work? Ahaha☆ You know your stuff when it comes to me, Anzu-san!

> Option 1: But it’s New Year’s……

**Ibara**: Yes, I understand. Please refrain from worrying.

I had a good rest at the end of the year, and I took a rest this morning!

> Option 2: Same here.

**Ibara**: Same…… Does that mean you’re also here for work?

There was something you really wanted to confirm…… I see, that means we’re the same☆

> Option 3: What happened?

**Ibara**: No no! That doesn’t mean there’s any trouble afoot!

I have some work to do before the New Year. After New Year’s passes, things will get even busier♪

### Episode 2

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/kvaztbhq.png">

(Location: ES Lobby)

**Ibara**: Adam and Eve have increased their work output… Correct?

For you to notice that, as expected of Producer-dono!

This is preparation for us as Eden to win a certain battle……♪

> Option 1: Battle?

**Ibara**: Indeed. The big business battle upon the horizon……

I’ve been preparing since last year to win this event!

> Option 2: What about all the members……

**Ibara**: I haven’t told anyone about the plan yet…… I’m not trying to hide it, though.

If we gather together as Eden after the new year, then I’ll tell them.

> Option 3: I have an idea of what it might be.

**Ibara**: Of course! But I can’t reveal it, I’ve yet to tell His Excellency and His Highness.

…… However, if it’s Anzu-san then you’re already aware of my plans without me revealing them, right?

### Episode 3

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/yb1k7bjy.png">

(Location: ES Lobby)

**Ibara**: Now, Anzu-san must be busy so it’s about time I take my leave.

Thank you for taking the time to chat with someone like me!

I hope it will be a good year where the both of us get the results we want.

> Option 1: Do your best.

**Ibara**: Aye aye♪ I will spare no efforts to obtain the victory I desire for Eden!

No matter what kind of interference they throw at us, I’ll use every means possible to annihilate them☆

> Option 2: Please don’t overdo it.

**Ibara**: It’s still New Year’s so don’t stay too late…… Is what you’re saying?

…… Thank you for your concern! I’ll return as soon as I can, so there’s no need to worry!

> Option 3: I’m looking forward to this year’s Eden.

**Ibara**: Ahaha! Stay tuned for it!

Let’s make as many people as possible become captivated by Eden this year!

## Nagisa Ran - ...... Taking a Sweet Detour

### Episode 1

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/kw2c9377.png">

(Location: Time Street)

**Nagisa**: …… Good afternoon, Anzu-san. We’re working together today.

…… There’s still time before the meeting time, but would you like to head to the site now?

…… That shop over there looks crowded. Is there some kind of event going on?

> Option 1: It might be a Valentine’s Day fair.

**Nagisa**: …… It feels like New Year’s only just happened, but it’s that time of year again.

…… We have time so let’s take a look. I might find some delicious chocolate.

> Option 2: Shall we take a look?

**Nagisa**: …… We have time, let’s do it.

…… Hmm, it looks like a chocolate fair. It seems they have a variety of things for sale.

> Option 3: There are a lot of women.

**Nagisa**: …… Ah, it seems like they have Valentine’s Day chocolate on display.

…… The red and white decorations are eye-catching. The store itself is also decorated nicely.

### Episode 2

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/yjfjsj2p.png">

(Location: Time Street)

**Nagisa**: …… Surprisingly mellow. A bitter tendency. A refreshing melt-in-your-mouth feeling. Sweet melted milk. Is this caramel?

…… There are more varieties than I thought. Various boxes and contents.

…… How do people choose the chocolate they want?

> Option 1: I wonder if it’s the taste.

**Nagisa**: …… Hmm, there’s a wide variety of chocolates from sweet to bitter.

…… People will choose the chocolate in their preferred flavor. It’s only natural.

> Option 2: Researching in advance……

**Nagisa**: …… Where they come to the store after deciding what to buy.

…… That’s a smart idea. I didn’t know anything beforehand so I was spoiled for choice with chocolates.

> Option 3: Intuition.

**Nagisa**: …… That means they’re buying based on what first appealed to them.

…… I don’t really know, but maybe there’s some chocolates I’m attracted to?

### Episode 3

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/vqcss5wo.png">

(Location: Time Street)

**Nagisa**: …… Since we came all the way here, I was thinking about buying some chocolates to bring back home.

…… Just finding a few interesting chocolates isn’t enough to decide.

…… I knew it. It’s difficult to choose.

> Option 1: Are you going to buy them all……

**Nagisa**: …… All? I see. I hadn’t thought of that.

…… It might be good for me to taste them and compare which chocolates I like.

> Option 2: Why not ask someone from Eden?

**Nagisa**: …… I see, I don’t have to decide on my own.

…… It feels like everyone will have opinions to offer so I’ll try to listen to them later.

> Option 3: Don’t worry about it.

**Nagisa**: …… That’s right. There’s still time before Valentine’s Day.

…… There’s still time before the meeting time, but would you like to head to the site now?

## Nagisa Ran - ...... Working Together

### Episode 1

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/qicsoo62.png">

(Location: Lounge in TV Station)

**Nagisa**: …… Hello, Anzu-san. Did you come to see me?

…… Yes, I’m working as Adam today.

…… Speaking of which, it’s been a long time since you’ve seen us work as Adam.

> Option 1: It was wonderful.

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu, thank you. I’m happy to hear you say that.

…… Working together with Ibara like this makes me feel nostalgic.

> Option 2: You have a lot of work as Adam.

**Nagisa**: …… Indeed. According to Ibara’s plan, work as Adam will increase. Although, I’m not sure what the plan is yet.

…… He plans to explain it the next time Eden gathers together.

> Option 3: What about the work for Eden……

**Nagisa**: …… It’s going well. Even if the amount is smaller.

…… I also like working as Adam, but… I’m a bit disappointed that the chances to meet with everyone in Eden has decreased.

### Episode 2

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/fcqkwr0x.png">

(Location: Lounge in TV Station)

**Nagisa**: …… Are you worried about Ibara? That’s what your face tells me.

…… Don’t worry. It’s fine if it’s Ibara. Even now he’s being contacted by companies and leaving in a good mood.

…… He’s busy as usual, so there’s no need to be worried.

> Option 1: I trust you.

**Nagisa**: …… Yes, I have faith in him. Ibara is a precious member of Eden.

…… But I’m glad that you were worried about Ibara…… So, thank you.

> Option 2: I look forward to working with you.

**Nagisa**: …… Yes, just leave it to me. I’m Eden’s leader, after all.

…… I will keep an eye on Ibara.

> Option 3: But……

**Nagisa**: …… If he takes on more work than he can handle, then I’ll take care of it.

…… After listening to what Ibara has to say, we’ll discuss what to do next, so don’t worry.

### Episode 3

<img src="/images/SecondEra/RR/clxqe9nv.png">

(Location: Lounge in TV Station)

**Nagisa**: …… Come to think of it, I wonder if Anzu-san is familiar with Chocolat Fes.

…… I haven’t heard from Ibara yet, but…

…… Perhaps Eden will also participate in this year’s Chocolat Fes.

> Option 1: I’m looking forward to it.

**Nagisa**: …… Yes, I’m looking forward to it as well. I’ve never participated in Chocolat Fes before.

…… Just imagining the stage wrapped in the sweet smell of chocolate is making my heart beat faster.

> Option 2: It’s full of chocolate.

**Nagisa**: …… Fufu, that’s good. I like chocolate, so I’m looking forward to it♪

…… But if I eat too much chocolate, I fear I may be scolded by Ibara later.

> Option 3: Handmade chocolate……

**Nagisa**: …… Do we make chocolate? In the past, there was an idol who did something like that.

…… It’s not just about singing and dancing. I wonder, what kind of plan Ibara is making?
